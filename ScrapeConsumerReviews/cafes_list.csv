0,cafes_list,"Pros: Lots of items you would not expect from a Chinese bakery Friendly owners Great Value Cons: Service can be slow when it's busy Having read the previous reviews, apparently the owners of this place changed recently. I never experienced this place with the previous owners so I can only base my reviews on how they are now. ABC is your standard Chinese bakery with a lot of hot food you can order as well. I have always seen this place whenever I come to same plaza for dim sum. It looks very small on the outside but there's a large amount of tables and space when you come inside. ABC has all the items you would expect from a Chinese bakery and then some. For breakfast, they have a couple of combos that of great value ion my opinion. I got a combo which included a beef brisket noodle, egg sandwich and a very large cold milk tea for $6.50. The beef brisket noodle had a great amount of brisket and a good amount of veggies to boot. Normally you get no veggies at all! I love the owners. It seems to be a ma and pa type of ownership. They were very nice and friendly. Their English could use some work but they try very hard to get an understanding with you if you don't speak Chinese. It seems though, that it's only them working the front with some kitchen staff in the back. When it get super busy, you can expect some wait times. I'm really glad I decided to try this place out. I can so see myself coming here instead if I don't want to wait for dim sum. I love supporting a local business and this is straight up one of the businesses we should be supporting.",4-star,positive
1,cafes_list,"Best egg-tarts in town! There's really not much to say about a hong kong style fastfood restaurant. You don't come here for the customer service, you don't come here for the luxurious architecture, and you don't come here on a first date. What you do come here for is cheap and authentic hong kong dishes, the bakery, and the FRESH EGG TARTS.",4-star,positive
2,cafes_list,"I've been to ABC Bakery a few times since I read they were one of the top places for egg tarts. Nothing beat the first time I went though, I'd have given it 5 stars for those egg tarts. Unfortunately, the experience has been worse and worse with each time I've went. The fact that it's under new ownership explains a lot. On my most recent visit, I ordered a bowl of wonton noodles, a slice of Chinese White Honeycomb Cake (???), and an egg tart for $10 flat. The wonton noodles are okay, you get six (smaller-than-average) wontons in the bowl and a lot of noodles with some chopped scallions. The white honeycomb cake is decent and you get a fairly large slice. The supposed star of the show, the egg tart, was extremely disappointing. The egg tart looked like the biscuit ones, instead of with the flaky crust (????). When we asked, the lady (who doesn't speak any English) said it is a new low-fat recipe. The more health-conscious decision is not worth it because there wasn't much rise in the pastry itself and it became more dense to eat. The egg custard was also bland and lacked flavour and sweetness. I've never really had bad egg tarts before but this was by far the worst in my experience. The mini dim sum egg tarts are better, even ones from Chinese buffets I'd say are better. While everything was cheap, I was left with an unsatisfying experience from a longtime favourite. I might give it one more try, though not for many months. I'd have given it a 1-star rating, but I'll give it an extra star based on its history and for the previous owners.",2-star,negative
3,cafes_list,"FYI, Closed Monday's New ownership for about 10 weeks, new menu's, the classic egg tart is not the same as it was before, it was hot but not cook long enough in the oven or something as the egg tart is stuck to the aluminum holder and as you try to pry the egg tart off, it literally fell apart, NOT GOOD. Nice try by the new owners but not enough for me to come back. Unfortunately the previous owners has retired. It was a great institution for so long as I will find another place before they become all extinct.",1-star,negative
4,cafes_list,"The inside may not look like much but they make a mean egg tart and have very good BBQ pork buns. This place is very old school and has that charm, reminds me of the bakery cafes I grew up with....their lunch menu items are also very good, I tend to order the rice noodles when I am in the hood.",4-star,positive
5,cafes_list,I usually come for the egg tart and it is one of the best Hong Kong style Egg Tart!! They always bake it so always fresh for egg tart. so custard is warm and silky smooth.,5-star,positive
6,cafes_list,"Everything, I meant everything were good. Were there for week day breakfast. Service was quick and exactly what I asked for. The fresh from the over egg tart, OMG, sooooo good. Services are good. Very nice owner and accommodating.",5-star,positive
7,cafes_list,"It's more like 3 and a 1/2 stars, but if value is your thing, and a $5 lunch wins the game for you, then it's a 4 and a 1/2 stars. The hot kitchen menu is CHEAP AF, and consistently good. Simple, but good. I usually order the Beef Brisket on Rice, as I admire the cheap meat's tenderness to price ratio, which is seemingly earned from hours of cooking. A bit fatty, even for brisket, and there's not much to it except the beef over rice. Good enough for a quick lunch.",3-star,negative
8,cafes_list,"This place got to have the best Hong Kong style egg tarts in town. The egg custard is warm and silky smooth and the pastry is flaky like puff pastry. The combination is just a perfect marriage. So thankful for the one who invented this tart for a afternoon snack favourite for many people from Hong Kong. The milk tea is also really creamy with rich black tea taste. I always come here just for the egg tarts. I had to wait 20 minutes for the freshly baked egg tarts. For $0.95 a tart is a wonderful price with a large milk tea for $1.60 is really nice to my wallet. lol! The decor is a little dated, but I like the newly renovated washroom. T",4-star,positive
9,cafes_list,"Make a quick stop here while waiting for dim sum next door. We got the toast and milk tea, both were good. My favorite thing about this place is the decor though, it kind of reminds me of the chacanting in hk :)",4-star,positive
10,cafes_list,"Ordered the lunch take out special ""D"", BBQ pork with rice and bok choy. Very fresh, hot and flavorful. The pork is tender and lean. The rice is fresh and steamed nicely. The bok choy is tender yet crisp. All this for $4.95 plus tax. Staff are very friendly and the food took no time to get ready. Highly recommend it for someone looking for fresh food in a timely manner. A wise choice for the value conscious.",5-star,positive
11,cafes_list,"I love this place! Their weekday lunch specials are around 5 bucks and a lot of food! Each time I went, none of my friends have finished their meal. It tastes great and the boss lady was really nice. Um... Two friend who went there and got diarrhoea after eating. Not sure if it was their food. Egg tarts are really really good!",5-star,positive
12,cafes_list,Good egg tarts and dishes here. My step dad likes the curry chicken while I like the noodles. I've tried three different noodles they offered and liked all of them.,4-star,positive
13,cafes_list,"My husband works near here and has never been inside, until I told him to go today. I read the Yelp reviews and thought I'd give it a try. We usually go somewhere else to buy egg tarts but their pastry cases have been getting hard, so we need a new place to get them from now. He brought back 6 and they were still hot when he got them home, wish he'd not let them sweat in the plastic bag. They were a tad sweet for my liking but they were delicious. The cases were flaky but not too crumbly, like most places, that just disintegrate, when you bite or touch them. Only negative was the really orange colour of the shell and filling. My 11 year old gave them a big thumbs up, but she likes any dessert. My 9 year old daughter, who doesn't normally eat egg tarts, period, ate one and said it was ok. We will be getting our egg tarts from here in future and giving Les Chateau a miss.",4-star,positive
14,cafes_list,"My search for my favorite egg tarts continued! I love that old school vibe at ABC Bakery. This cafe has been around for over 20 years and I did have high expectations for their egg tart. Egg Tart & Milk Tea ($2.45) Just maybe because of my personal preference, I love the egg custard which has this sweet and aromatic smell of eggs and the texture is smooth. But the crust itself was heavy and doughy even when the tart was still warm to touch. The Milk Tea was meh. Not hot enough, not smooth enough and just not up to par. While I was there, most people were here buying egg tarts and egg tarts only as there was only some stale uninteresting offerings on the display. I doubt I will be back. I should have read my Yelp Friend's review before coming :)",2-star,negative
15,cafes_list,"I've been on the hunt for the best egg tarts in Toronto... and this place is my new favorite (so far at least). The tart is really tasty, and seemed freshly baked when we got them. They are massive as well... and really cheap (85c). Amazing value given how good these things taste. My only complaint is that the pastry itself is a little too crumbly, and also I'd prefer the top to be more burnt (Macau style). But these are very minor complaints. Cash only. Ample parking. No tax if you buy 6.",5-star,positive
16,cafes_list,"As a Chinese who spent most of his childhood in Hong Kong, there is one Chinese traditional snack that every child would love eating from young to even when they are a full adult like me! Can you guess what that snack is? You can find it in almost every Chinese Bakery. Yes it's the EGG TARTS!! I have been searching for great Egg Tarts and I was always a fan of Les Chateaux's Egg Tarts because they make very consistent good egg tarts, but I am happy and surprised I found somewhere that makes even better ones! ABC Bakery Coffee Shop probably bakes the BEST Egg Tarts in Markham area. They are always in high demand and last time I came, I had to wait 15 minutes for their new batch as the old were sold out. Even then, I had 3 people in front of me waiting for the new batch too! And everyone grabbed half dozen so they run out VERY fast! If you are a big Egg Tart person, I highly recommend coming here to grab some!",4-star,positive
17,cafes_list,"This unassuming bakery tucked in the corner of a Scarborough strip mall is not the place you'd consider as having the best egg tarts in the city; however, after reading such positive reviews from other yelpers I had to give them a try. I bought one for myself and one for another yelper. The total was under $2 (impressive!) and were still warm as they sat in their special case by the counter. After a 40 minute trip to my friend's home, I couldn't believe they were still warm! The middle is very silky; and in contrary to some other reviewers, my crust was nice and flaky. As mentioned in other reviews, they have an extensive menu aside from the tarts and all prices appear reasonable for the portion size. I would definitely consider returning again if I had a craving for egg tarts and would encourage others to go and try this place.",4-star,positive
18,cafes_list,"I came here to check out the egg tarts. I was a bit disappointed. I do love the custard but not the pastry. The pastry was very thick and I didn't like it at all. I doubt I will be returning for the egg tarts. I also bought some buns, and they weren't soft .. it was very thick and hard. After trying several items, I will not be coming back here.",2-star,negative
19,cafes_list,"Decided to check this place out after reading such wonderful reviews their egg tarts received. The reviews were right. The tarts were nice and silky. Also, the elderly lady behind the counter was quite warm and friendly as well. Service with a smile is not common in other bakeries of this type I've been to.",4-star,positive
20,cafes_list,Their egg tart is the best in town. I always loved their egg tart as a kid. My mom would bring me there after school and I will order an egg tart for snack. Yummm~~~,4-star,positive
21,cafes_list,Heard about the great egg tarts here and went up there specifically to try them. They were soooooo good. The pastry is what a HK egg tart should be and the filling is perfect (so silky and perfectly eggy). The decor is terrible but as long as egg tarts stay good I will keep going.,5-star,positive
22,cafes_list,"I slowly backed my ass out of Crown Prince Fine Dining & Banquet as soon as I realized my net asset near my rear asset only had a $5.00 paper currency. ABC Bakery a few doors down sounded more within my current Net Present Value so I went in more confidently. Chinese Bakery also doing HK Cafe food. Not exactly the biggest selection of Baked Breads or Pastries but enough on offer for the blue/white collars working nearby. Standard priced Noodle/Rice dishes on offer. 2.5 *Star* Egg Tart & Milk Tea($2.10) Fresh still warm-from-oven Egg Tart was flakey however it was the DENSE flakey variety rather than airy. Not sure if it's due to the warm status of the Egg Tart but the custard within had pockets of separation which looked less appealing but I didn't taste any difference. Milk Tea was quite nice and enjoyable. Best part was getting the $2.90 in coins back in my pocket. The environment atmosphere was a bit awkward. The customers were either single individuals or even when in multiples they were freaky quiet compare to any HK Bakery Cafes. That combined with no focal point of either Televsion/Radio or decor made this place feel stale/boring/depressing! A spot where you eat, mind your own business and ""clap flies"".",2-star,negative
23,cafes_list,"if u like egg tart, this is the place u should go. Usually u will find ppl waiting in front of the counter for the freshly baked egg tarts. All gone in a sec. I think their deep fried stuff is ok, but I can't think up any drink is good from this bakery. So I will only grab half or a dozen egg tarts and go.",3-star,negative
24,cafes_list,"The only reason why I went to this out-of-the-way Chinese bakery in an older strip plaza with free parking is based on the strength of the recommendations by various friends on its Cantonese-style egg custard tarts. I love custard tarts! Yummy! The custard tarts had just the right amount of straight-from-the-oven warm jiggly, sweet custard goodness deep in the middle, with a delicious outer crust. I had three as soon as I bought them - and regardless of whether or not that was a good idea, I don't regret it a bit! The strange thing is that while others have told me that the crust is supposed to be the flakey version, mine was less flakey and more solid. Doesn't detract from me inhaling them all though. This bakery has been around for a long time and I can't believe I've only gone there now. It also serves other Chinese cafe style foods as well as other Chinese pastries with seating. However, given the prominence that the custard tarts receive in its own heated baking tray by the counter rather than with the rest of the pastries, I'd say that this place knows what it's good at.",4-star,positive
25,cafes_list,Went here for lunch today.... great service and atmosphere. Great attitude from the owner!! THE BEST empanadas I've had in my life. I highly recommend. And I will be a frequent customer here!! So good!,5-star,positive
26,cafes_list,My husband and I checked out the food here. It's was pretty good. I liked the unique flavors in their pastries. It's definitely a place that I would come back to. My one critique is I felt like the savory pies were a little dry. Maybe it was just the day? I'll definitely come and check them out again.,4-star,positive
27,cafes_list,Food and service are both amazing. Hand pies are out of this world. We tried green Chile Mac which was killer and several of the hand pies the Green Chile pork is not to be missed.,5-star,positive
28,cafes_list,"If you're not looking for this place, you won't ""happen upon"" it; it's tucked into the very end of a strip mall, hidden behind a tattoo shop. Take my word for it: LOOK FOR THIS PLACE! I went in around 1pm on a Thursday. The guy behind the counter, who turned out to be an owner, was super welcoming, friendly & helpful. You can order sweet or savory hand pies, along with from scratch soups and sides. Grain salads, potato dishes...all yummy. I ordered a combo: hand pie & side of potato. I went with the Jamaican Beef Patty hand pie & hatch green chile potatoes with Monterrey Jack cheese. SO GOOD. SO GOOD. SO GOOD. Nice, comfy seating area, good tunes, good food. Do yourself a favor and support a small, local business & get some from-scratch love from this kitchen. You won't be sorry!",4-star,positive
29,cafes_list,Always a 5 star meal here. The hand pies are so tasty and savory. The hatch green chilies give the perfect kick. The chocolate pie was awesome. The green chili corn chowder was so good and it was a huge bowl. Love how they have flavored water like today was cucumber mint. Everything scratch made and you can watch them make it behind the counter. It smells amazing inside. One of my favorites.,5-star,positive
30,cafes_list,This my new favorite brunch or lunch spot! The hand pies are so yummy and such good quality ingredients! They have a great selection of sweet and savory offerings with interesting ingredient parings. Small and off the beaten path but totally worth it!,5-star,positive
31,cafes_list,"Delicious, different and savory. The gentleman behind the counter was super helpful and nice. Green chili pork was delicious. Slight dry, but maybe that's the way they are supposed to be? I would add cheese on the inside to moisten it, but what do I know. I will surely be coming back and using them for catering and frozen delicious dinners to go.",5-star,positive
32,cafes_list,"I give this place an A+. I came here back in 2014 or so and loved it then. After being out of town a couple of years I came back in 2017 and loved it even more I think. Both times I got a hand pie and soup to eat on the premises and then bought about $30 more to take home. I would call them pasties because I'm from Michigan but someone else might think of them as empanadas because we're closer to Mexico. Either way they are delicious and reasonably priced. Their soups are homemade, hearty, and scrumptious in any kind of weather. The only problem I have is the place closes at 4 and sometimes I don't get out the door till after that so it's harder for me to get there before they close than it might be for the average person that gets an earlier start. And the other problem is deciding what flavor to get because they are all so good!",5-star,positive
33,cafes_list,"I am really at a lost here, I read the reviews again and it really made no sense to me at all. I had 2 Empanadas and the green chillie potatoes and I really did not taste that great to me. The Empandas were meat breakfast ones and were really dry and the crust was hard. I have had much better and they were like 7.00 and were the size of those hostess pies. The potatoes were cold which was weird because I can hear them cooking something in the back and I was the only one customer there. They were not that good even if they were warm because they were hard and not done yet. Well I will chalk it up to it is not my thing if these other people are raving mad about them.",2-star,negative
34,cafes_list,"Dammit man! Finally, a place that has killer coffee and amazing food without stupidly large portions. It seems that many Americans equate ridiculous quantities of food with ""value"", and overlook the quality and love that go into a well prepared dish. We had green chili empenada, green chili / cheese potatoes, quiche loraine, white bean spinach and tomato soup, and some killer lemon and pineapple pies for a treat afterwards. Everything was astonishingly good. What a relief to get away from silly huge omelettes and monster plates of pancakes and just eat something wonderful, then depart without a bellyache. Eat here soon! Before you die!",5-star,positive
35,cafes_list,Seriously so good. From the service to the amazing food. Wish they were more visible so more people can see but I'm glad we found it! Will definitely be back. The empanada combos are a perfect little meal they will fill you up and don't forget to try their creme brûlée!,5-star,positive
36,cafes_list,"Great selection of flavorful empanadas (hand-pies). Highly Recommended! Friends wanted to meet for brunch, so I browsed my Yelp bookmarks and came up with AZ Food Crafters. Everyone agreed, so we gave it a try - and we were very glad we did! Food: I love the variety on the menu - so many things to try! And since Hatch chiles are in season, AZ Food Crafters has a special selection, which I was eager to try. I ended up with the Two Savory Pies combo so I could sample two different hand pies. I had the Green Chile Pork Empanada (a favorite of Yelpers) and the Green Chile Relleno, one of their spicier choices. I have one word to describe this: WOW!! The empanada crust was nice and flaky, not dense and chewy. And the flavors were amazing! My order came with ranch dressing and a wonderful hatch chile sauce, which was great for dipping. I must say, while the Green Chile Pork was flavorful, it was also fairly dry. I expected it to be a bit more moist. But the Green Chile Relleno, made with Hatch chiles, was simply excellent! It was moist, and fairly spicy - although not over-the-top-burn-your-lips-off spicy. This one's a definite repeater. With my Yelp check-in, I also got a free dessert empanada - so cool. I decided on another Hatch chile selection: the Green Chile & Apple Pie with a Cheddar Crust. Holy smokes, was this good!!! If you come here while this is still available, by all means get it!! It was sweet and spicy, and a bit cheesy too. Amazing flavors! I can't recall what everyone else had, but they were all happy with their selections. Cost: My Two Savory Pie Combo was a very reasonable $7.50 before tax. The amazing dessert pie was free, otherwise would have been $4. So ya, AZ Food Crafters has great value. Service: The staff were very friendly, patiently answering all our first-timer questions. It took a while for our food to come out, but not too long, and we all got fresh, hot empanadas. Atmosphere: The seating area is very small, probably seats around a dozen people. And the ""kitchen"" area is just across the counter, which is neat because you can watch the staff do their work. All-in-all the atmosphere is ok, but nothing special. Overall: I was really impressed with the food and staff, and can't wait to return to try some of the other selections. This one's definitely made the regular rotation!",5-star,positive
37,cafes_list,"What a small but amazing place!! This place gives u variety of empanadas to choose from, very affordable and delicious... My boyfriend and I ordered chicken pot pie, apple pie, Sriracha chicken Philly, lemon blueberry empanadas with a side of green chili Mac and cheese.. Everything was amazing so we ordered two more to go.. You have a option for them to pre heat the empanadas or pre heat them urself it comes with directions and ingredients on the bag.. If you also play Pokemon go player your in luck because they have a poke stop right in front..you also get a free sweet empanadas when you check in on Yelp",5-star,positive

39,cafes_list,"When my husband told me he went to get 'breakfast' empanadas with our son, he couldn't stop talking about how good it was. I thought to myself that he was just exaggerating because all of the other empanadas (hand pies) I've tried have been alright. He forced me to come with our son the next day and I was skeptical about the place. Boy was I wrong. Review of the restaurant: The restaurant has a small dining area but it's very clean, quaint, and had cute cases of flowers at each table. The owner/staff: The owner was incredibly nice and helpful too. While we were waiting for our food, he brought out some Chex Mix cereal and fruit for our toddler, which I thought was incredibly kind and thoughtful! He came by to check on us multiple times to see if we needed anything and to see how the food tasted. The food: Seriously, these hand pies are the best things I've ever tasted!!! The shell was so flaky and flavorful and had the perfect ""thickness"" where it didn't overpower the contents on the inside. The fillings we tried were green chile Mac and cheese, chicken pot pie, ham and cheddar breakfast pie, and a blueberry and lemon sweet hand pie. Every single one was so delicious and it's hard to choose a favorite. You cannot go wrong with whichever hand pie you choose!",5-star,positive
40,cafes_list,"I am an experienced cook, baker and empanada maker, so I am a little picky. I have to say that every single thing we ate was absolute perfection! I ordered the chorizo ""hand pie"" which is really an empanada to me. I got the combination plate which came with hand pie (empanada or pasty) a side of fresh fruit and a side. I chose mac and cheese with squash. I also ordered the potatoes with green chile. Yum! The chorizo was flavorful, but mild. No problem, because the green chile sauce really added to it! I used up all of my sauce and had to ask for more. Then I HAD to take a jar home too. :-) We do not eat out much, but we used to go to a pasty place down the street a few times a year. No more... this place really hit the spot. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and quality ingredients. For the three of us the lunch was probably around $35-$40. Not sure since we took some dessert pies home. A dozen for $14. Perfect. They were really small, but that's one of the reasons I like this place more than the other pasty (think empanada or pie) place. Smaller is better because you can try different flavors. The hand pie is somewhat small, but with a side and fruit, the meal really fills you up. At least all three of us left full (I had to pawn off some of my amazing potatoes to my daughter because two sides was a little much) and did not even touch the dessert pies till later.",5-star,positive
41,cafes_list,"Got hooked on hand pies after trying them at a farmer's market then I found that they have a store right by my house! I've been in a couple times but since trying that first hand pie, I've adopted a plant based diet. Only reason for 4 stars is the lack of vegetarian/vegan options. Please expand the menu a bit for those of us who don't want animal products.",4-star,positive
42,cafes_list,"Discovered your cafe while searching for someplace new and different to have breakfast this morning. Three words sum up our experience: Clean, friendly, and delicious. Loved the Yucatan Pork Stew and Lemon Sweet Pie. Also enjoyed the Chicken Sriracha hand pie as well as the Chorizo and Egg hand pie with a side of hatch green chili sauce. The sauce was so good, we bought two bottles to take home. Carmen enjoyed her Spinach, Mushroom, Tomato Omelette hand pie ad Creamy Potato and Chicken soup. We'll definitely be back.",5-star,positive
43,cafes_list,"Finally this place (which you may know from farmer's markets around the Phoenix area), has a permanent location. And it happens to be in my neighborhood. Tiny little place, it seats like 12 people. And the service varies between laid back and more laid back. But they are very nice, and in their defense, they are not sitting around but constantly working. The pies are flaky and very flavorfu. I love to get one of their combos (1 sweet/1 savory with a salad), or two of their combos if I'm really hungry. And then I take serveral frozen pies home...and some times a creme brulee...because, who can pass up on creme brulee. And believe me, I'm telling you NEVER PASS ON THE CREME BRULEE. It's to die for. The only thing i don't care for is the very short hours of operation. I can never go there cause they open and close in the time it takes me to blink.

45,cafes_list,"Checked this spot out for breakfast today because, who wouldn't want a hot/savory hand pie for breakfast and a free sweet pie from a yelp check in? I ordered three hand pies, maple bacon, Turkey sausage, ham and cheese for my group, plus a lemon cherry sweet hand pie. Since the pies were to-go, they take approx 5 min to bake so if you're in a super rush keep that in mind. They are then placed in aluminum foil wrappers to trap heat which is really nice. The pies itself have the highs and lows. The crust of the pie is amazing and on point, but our group came to the agreement that the fillings, while good, had nothing spectacular about them. Perhaps coming in for one of their hand pie specials from the lunch menu might have been better. At the end of the day, the food here is good and is worth the price of the hand pie in terms of the effort and ingredients put in. However, if you're looking for bang for the buck in the hearts of quantity of food, this place might not be for you.",4-star,positive
46,cafes_list,"My husband and I went to check out this spot for lunch today and everything we tried was delicious! I had the green chili pork hand pie with a side of mac & cheese. The hatch green chili sauce on the side was incredible, as was the cilantro lime sour cream. My husband tried the Hot Brown (turkey breast, bacon & tomato) hand pie with Italian sausage and potato chowder soup. The hand pies were some of the best pastries we've ever had! The portions didn't look very big at first but both of us left feeling satisfied. I wanted to try the sea salt carmel crème brulee but was too full by the time we were done eating. This is a quaint location that doesn't look like much from the outside, but do yourself a favor and venture in... it's worth it! I can't wait to go back to try the other items on the menu. YUM!",5-star,positive
47,cafes_list,Really delicious food. Quaint and located in a plaza. The decor could have been better but it's kind of an after thought if you have amazing foods. I pretty much ate the whole menu. Also had both flavors of the cream brûlée. I'm a huge fatty.,4-star,positive

50,cafes_list,"There are few times in life where something exceeds your expectations. Sadly, losing my virginity wasn't one of those times. But, I digress. My wife has been driving by this spot for quite some time and finally decided to look it up on Yelp. She liked the reviews and told me about it. Fast forward to today when, while running errands, I spotted this place and said hey let's give it a try. First of all the smell when we walked in was AHHHHMAZING!!!! It was their ""bake day"" as the gentleman at the counter called it. Anyways we ended up ordering 5 pies and then a box of mini sweet pies. We tried one of the minis on the way back to the office, and needless to say 1 turned into 6 before we got back to work, that's how good those were. Then the savory main pies. HOLY SH!T. Flaky, delicious crust enveloping the most incredible flavors. To quote the Simpsons ""It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone is invited."" The El Cubano was my fav. but the Chicken Parm was amazing goodness. My wife LOVED her Green Chile Pork and also her Chicken Pot Pie. Our co-worker really enjoyed her Spinach and Cheese.

52,cafes_list,"This is a review of the restaurant experience. The environment and service are both good, so I'll get right to the food. I had the $6 green pork chili hand pie/chocolate creme brulee combo. The prices are low on the absolute scale, but the portion size reflects this. It will satisfy the average hunger and is about the same size as some fast food places, but there are other restaurants at similar price points that offer quite a bit more food. You do get a side salad with the hand pie, so that helps some. Next time, I would order it with no dressing because the salad dressing tasted a bit weird. The hand pie and creme brulee were both tasty and made with care. The creme brulee topping was on the thicker side, but the flavor was there. I liked my meal and dining experience, and I would like to return.",4-star,positive

Definitely my new favorite.",5-star,positive
55,cafes_list,"I found this place through a discount offer that my gym had given to me. So it was also very close to my gym at my house and where I work, so very convenient for me. I went one time for lunch and got the tuna wrap and a coconut protein ball. The second time I got the turkey meatballs and a coconut protein ball, as well as a piece of strawberry cheesecake for later. All of these items were amazing. I would go back anytime. Especially the variety of cheesecakes is amazing and one piece of it is only 150 cal, which is incredible. The tuna wrap was yummy. I did not like the turkey meatballs too much but that was not because they weren't good, that was only because I like a lot of seasoning and spices, so to me they tasted kind of bland. I am definitely going to go back to get the protein balls once in a while. They are so big you can park them in four pieces. The staff is amazingly friendly. And the second time I walked in the girl that works there recognized me, so that was a super awesome experience. I have recommended This place already to multiple other people",5-star,positive

59,cafes_list,"When I reviewed Adi's cafe 4-months ago I was writing from the positive experience. Up until recently the lunches and check-ins here were consistently wonderful so I recommended this place to several coworkers. Today for lunch I ordered the turkey burger which is sandwiched between two thick slices of sweet potato rather than a bun. I've ordered this once before and it was delicious. When I was presented my food I could tell it was different than before as the lettuce was different and it seemed very runny. Upon cutting open the turkey patty I saw more liquid and uncooked meat which turned me off. So I walked up to the counter to address that my food was not thoroughly cooked. The immediate reaction by the staff was an excuse or defensive approach ""oh, we cook with paprika that's probably it""...instead of examining the meat and seeing it truly was half-cooked. Then once she realized it was in need of further cooking she sent back to the kitchen. After a few minutes passed, I was greeted with the same exact meal I was served - yes, that's right - the turkey patty I cut in half with the same sweet potato slices and all topped together as if to pass it on as brand new. I understand not being wasteful, but never in any other dining experiences have I been served the original dish if anything was in question. And, it's usually met with an apology, not a defensive approach. I was beyond disappointed in lack of care and have decided that today would be my last visit. Hopefully the coworkers I've sent over don't share in my experience when they order.",2-star,negative

62,cafes_list,"I've been here a few times, I usually order the Sweet Potato Wrap which has chicken, avocado, and spinach. This time I wanted to try something different so I looked through the menu online. The Thai Peanut Sweet Potato Noodles looked appealing by the image posted on the menu. It was listed for $8, and you can add chicken for an additional $2. So that's what I decided to order, along with a strawberry and kiwi detox water. My total came out to be $14 and some change. I ordered for a pick up so I can take it back to work. I picked up my order, the staff was courteous. When I got back to work, I looked at my food and it was NOT as advertised on the menu online. It was EXTREMELY cold, the cubed chicken that was added was dry and cold. The taste of the sauce was very awkward and bland. Everything was just kinda mushed together like a typical potato salad. It was not actual noodles as the image I seen online, it's shreds/strips of sweet potato. The strawberry and kiwi detox water was just overloaded with fruits I could barley stir my straw around to get the little amount of water that was in the cup. When I called and told them I was not satisfied with my order, the girl who answered the phone kind of shook it off. She did not show strong customer service qualities in making the situation better. Overall, I'm sad to say this was a unsatisfactory visit and I don't think I will be spending my money here.",2-star,negative

65,cafes_list,"Gluten free, low carb, no added fat, and no added sugar. Sweet potato everything here. Great concept. No sugar is added to any of their items. I learned that the longer you cook/bake a sweet potato, the sweeter it gets and that is where they get their sweetness from. They use the white sweet potato in all of their items, which they have displayed throughout the place. Of course I had to try the sweet potato latte $5- it was ok. Adi's offers smoothies, breakfast bowls, salads, crepes, wraps, coffee, tea, and other healthy foods. I came during lunch time and decided to try one of their specials....chicken tacos with sweet potato tortilla. The tortilla felt like a mix between a tortilla and a pancake. It fell apart easily but the food was amazing (even the salsa that it came with). The gal gave me a sample of their banana, sweet potato/cinnamon muffin...perfectly moist with a little bit of sweetness. I purchased that muffin and a sweet potato energy bar To Go.

Here it's all about the vegetable, sweet potato right down to the sweet potato latte;) My favorite recommendation is the sweet potato bolognese- hearty and healthy! Healthier than a baked potato and yes, indeed more satisfying on those taste buds! Crepes! Healthy crepes, yes they can be healthy here at Adi's that is. I've only had the cocoa cream one and it is sweet and savory! Detox over one of the infused waters, yes water with a twist. My favorite is the blueberry & lime, different and will tantalize those taste buds. The sweet potato wedges are a crispy, roasted side and quite filling in a good way;).

This place creates a homey, comfortable and toasty vibe, perfect for both the cold and the coffee. I met a few friends here as they were finishing up their ""coffee break"" and we found ourselves locked into comfort and relaxation. Our coffee break was extended. One of my friends desired a bit more coffee and was granted a fresh refill for only $1 more. I have no doubt I will be returning again here soon.

As another reviewer pointed out two years ago, the baristas don't know how to pull shots properly.

The ambiance is hip for Monroe so it's a welcome harbor from the country vibe that permeates most of the other Monroe restaurants. It is a fabulous meeting spot and so it is unfortunate that their hours do not extend later into the evening for locals who work and commute. This seems to be a trend in downtown Monroe that drives people out to 74 for Awful Mc Donald's coffee and the surrounding historic district really suffers for it. But when you go, try a Chilly Alice, London Fog (earl grey and steamed milk) or a caramel latte!",5-star,positive

A downside for me is their drinks are pretty subpar, but the main draw is the food. Given that everything is gluten free and many things are vegan, the food is really good.

Since I already had 2 cups of coffee that morning... I passed but the gentlemen behind the counter was wonderful and convinced me their cookies were better than the regular wheat flour cookies. I bought 1 of the PB and one of the double chocolate chip... each about $2.75. So a few hours later... how were they? they definitely had that great crispy outer edge and softer middle. That surprised me so from a texture point of view... huge points as some GF are just heavy. The double chocolate chip was very rich in cocoa and not overly sweet. I liked how their chocolate chunk was more dark chocolate. The PB was actually one of the better PB cookies I've had... even competing against wheat ones. They werent wrong!

129,cafes_list,It's at the bottom of a medical building. Super weird location and my wife and I almost didn't go in. Thankfully we did. It's small and clean. Very clean. Food was surprisingly good.

137,cafes_list,"I was staying with some friends in Toronto over the weekend, and decided to venture out and grab some breakfast on my own. Considering this looked like my best option within walking distance, I chose to check out this little joint to get my brekkie on. Not sure if i was just really hungry, or if everything on the menu just seemed to be screaming my name. Simple fare, but edgy, and innovative. I wanted it all. That being said, I ordered the French Toast with Bacon. I feel you can probably judge any breakfast/brunch place based on their french toast AND their bacon, so this was a perfect combo. Wow. This is easily the BEST french toast I've ever had in my life. No joke. The edges were crispy, and there was a bit of salty notes that played well with the sweet caramelization happening. And, it may have been in my head, but i think there was a citrusy tone as well...which I'm not typically into when it comes to french toast, but holy cow....this stuff blew me away. It didn't look like much on the plate as far as presentation, but i mean...i didn't even care after biting into it. Oh, and let's talk about the bacon. THANK you for serving thick cut bacon. None of this wussy little soggy bacon crap. This bacon was thick, salty, and i want some more right now. I've recommended this place already to others. And if i'm back in Toronto...will be going back for SURE.",5-star,positive
138,cafes_list,"Chimi pork belly was the reason I brought my husband here for fathers day and it met all expectations. Fresh herby chimi sauce and three massive strips of tender pork belly. I had to steal some even though I don't like visible fat on meat, but clearly one gets over such an aversion when you are eating pork belly! French toast was perfect, thick smoked bacon was as delicious as the pork belly, and even the fries were pretty damn good. Displaced Aussies will love that they have a flat white on the menu and this new mama loved that the place was very child friendly. Sporting a change table outside of the bathroom stalls means my husband gets the luxury of changing the baby too ;) Not super speedy, but that's not the point. If you want a delicious brunch, strong coffee and a sunny window, sit back and enjoy the wait. Its worth it.",5-star,positive

141,cafes_list,"Food was delicious and different, would go back again. We both had the Chimi Pork, fries with around four slices of pork belly and two poached eggs. The churri sauce is light, not strong. And the other was the standard, came with two slices of bacon, not your regular bacon strips. Nutella mocha and latte was also delicious, one of the better drinks i've had. Music was a tad loud so had to speak up but didn't really bother me. Nice little brunch spot close to home!",4-star,positive

I had a grilled cheese sandwich and shared a blueberry waffle with my husband. Both were good, nothing spectacular but nothing bad. The portion sizes were fairly small. My only criticism is that everything we ate we could have easily made ourselves at home. I guess that means it really is home-cooked food? For what we wanted, it was alright, I guess it would have been nice to have something with a bit more ""pizzazz"".",3-star,negative
144,cafes_list,"So rarely does a restaurant's food quality match its service...in this case though, both were a bust. Went there for brunch and was not impressed. Super slow service - I think one server was working the entire restaurant. Had to ask for everything from cutlery to water to coffee refills. There seemed to be a lot of employees sort of lingering behind the bar doing various, non-essential things that didn't improve the restaurant experience. Basic food fare - besides the fact that not everything arrived (but was left on the bill) the food was not impressive. The BLT wrap was a very loose, small portion with very little flavor in the aioli and served solo on a white plate. The Bird's Nest looked similarly minimalist and unappealing and came with default poached eggs because the server forgot to ask egg preference. This place probably lends itself better to being as espresso bar than a restaurant because the coffee was pretty good, and the staff were very friendly...just not so great at restauranting.",2-star,negative
145,cafes_list,"I'm really sad to be writing a review like this but honesty is the best criticism to improve any establishment. I suggested to come back here after my drop in a couple months ago because the atmosphere was good and the service was friendly. I knew the menu was changing so when I saw their updated items through their Facebook page. . I was excited and intrigued. Walking in here at the same time on the same day of the week, everything was quite the opposite from my first visit. This time, it was super busy, people were not really attentive and the staff was overwhelmed. After waiting 10 mins and the waitress serving the table that came in after us, I went to the front to order my drink... I also ordered the yogurt parfait which I was excited to see a healthier option... supposed to be topped with berries and granola. When it came, you could've fooled me. What I got was a giant cup of yogurt... three sliced mini strawberries and 1 tablespoon of granola and a touch of honey. If I knew I was ordering yogurt w. Garnish, I would've skipped it and went straight for the Benny. At least I knew I would be getting two eggs, English muffin and sauce. This was misleading ans truly a disappointment. Not to my surprise, I heard at least two other complaints while I was there. Not sure what's happening but I hope things shape up.",1-star,negative
146,cafes_list,"What a delightful restaurant. First of all, it's all homemade. From the in-house smoked salmon to the delicious freshly baked breads that change daily. The chef works in an open work space and was very friendly and clearly takes great pride in his creations, as he should because everything was delicious. We tried the Smoked Salmon Benny as well as the Chimi Pork and Eggs. We concluded the meal with the Nutella Cake (Nutella cake with cream cheese espresso whip and caramel). It was sort of reminiscent of a nutty sticky date pudding but a million times better with a perfect level of sweetness. The staff were were pleasant. The space is itself is nice. We also stopped in for a quickly breaky. My bf and I each had a biscuit along with our espresso beverages and the biscuits were 5/5. **************************************** Update, there is a new chef who is nice but the place has lost what I loved about it.

Especially with the house made aoli. All of the veggies on my sandwich were nicely grilled and the fries were crispy. The Cost: Super reasonable! How many places in TO can you order a large homemade burger with all the toppings on house-baked bread that comes with a pile of crispy fries and a homemade garlic aioli for under $10? And from what my carnivorous friends tell me, it's fantastic. The Staff: Friendly and attentive. Happy to accommodate any request I have made during my many visits. I'm a vegetarian. No problem, we will modify what we can! I drink a lot of water with my meals. No problem, here is a jug of ice water just for you. The Atmosphere: Cool, casual, minimalist.

153,cafes_list,"I'm shocked that given the kind of service, price and very low standards of cleanliness that anyone would have given this more than 2 stars. I tend to trust reviewers who've got a lot of reviews under their belt, and, granted most of the reviews thus far (except one) were first time reviews (which always make me skeptical because, of course, no photos of reviewers which leads me to think it's written by the owner/chef/staff). So, here it goes - 1. First thing we see on a hot day Sloppy writing on the chalk board out front.We walk in, it's a hot morning, doors and windows closed, no a/c, room is stuffy. No one greets us, all of the staff are standing around at the cash, so we figure that there's no table service. We stand at the door for a few minutes - still nothing. I go up to the cash and ask and we're told there is table service. We seat ourselves (extremely uncomfortable chairs). Our server is friendly but the water glasses are half of a standard sized water glass in any other food establishment in the city - so, even more dependance on the slowish servers and more waiting for water refills. We were given menus - because of the cavernous ceilings, and irritating hipster electronica (better suited for an after hours bar than a neighbourhood/family friendly breakfast/brunch place) we can barely make out what's being said (to be clear - none of us have hearing issues). Unfortunately the menu doesn't offer information that would be useful when deciphering ingredients (for the average meal-goer) such has explanations of what harisa and chimi churri are. There are typos (""poach eggs""), which for such a small, ingredient specific (and overpriced) menu are really unacceptable (I tend to overlook this in many restaurants where English is not a first language, however, this doesn't appear to be the case here, just laziness). No drinks (coffee/tea/juices) are listed? Nothing to indicate if they're licensed or not. Lame-o common table in the centre - hell, if I'm paying that much money for a meal then I'm not sharing a table, unless it's with my group of friends/family. We both ordered the exact same dish and one was brought out and the second came 5 (!) minutes later. Really?? It wasn't busy or crowded, so what gives? Portions are RIDICULOUSLY small. The english muffins on which the eggs benny come (they must also be house made because no self-respecting baker would sell these) are more akin to slider size and the salad (I asked) was said to have a 'light dressing'. And by 'light' it was completely non-existent. Never in my life (amongst many continents and multiple countries) have I walked away hungry from a breakfast/brunch - until now. I paid $11 for a miniscule (below average tasting) eggs benny with a tiny amount of salad (not free range eggs, not organic greens, nothing notable except the disappointing portion size. The servers are friendly but clearly inexperienced and unseasoned. I feel like the chef here just watched too many cooking shows on tv and through osmosis decided he was actually a chef. Oh, and while you're eating? You get the distinct smell of dirty mop water wafting across the open kitchen, cash and onto the restaurant floor. Why is that? The dishwasher is doing dishes directly beside where the food is being prepared and cooked. Our dirty dishes sit untouched until we finally just get up to go pay the bill. The bathrooms are filthy. Paper towel dispenser completely empty first thing in the morning. The steps leading down to them are steep and unsafe (God help anyone with a toddler or over the age of 20 trying to navigate them. Or anywhere else for that matter. I feel utterly ripped off, taken advantage of and disappointed. Pity the poor souls who think this is the next manna from heaven. This place feels like they're just trying to take advantage of people, over charge,under deliver and get away with it. It incenses me that establishments like this exist. They've been open long enough to have ironed out any initial problems, so no sympathy here. Ashdale Brunch & Espresso, I'm sad to say that you truly disappoint. Go anywhere else but here - please!. Frankly (and anyone who knows my tastes can tell you I'm not a supporter of corporate/chemical/GMO foods), you're better off going across the street to the (conveniently located) McDonald's. You'll get your own table, better service, and a better portion size - all at a more reasonable price.",1-star,negative
154,cafes_list,"I'd like to give the Ashdale 3.5 stars. We've had brunch for the last two Sundays. The service and coffee are 5/5. Also 5/5 for the quality of the homemade food, it's well prepared, healthy, and delicious. My biggest issue is the consistently unavailable menu items. They've been sold out of the french toast and mac and cheese both times we've gone (and we're there more at a breakfast hour than a true brunch time). This is a pet peeve of mine. If you can't execute the menu, change the menu! I really wanted to try that french toast. Small deduction for the uncomfortable chairs as well, although I like the ambiance in general. Bacon can be subbed for the house-made chorizo sausage for some meals: I would not recommend. The chorizo was extremely dry and under-seasoned, while the bacon was delicious. Also, the washrooms downstairs are a little scary, but maybe they'll get around to cleaning those up a bit? Love the house-made bread and the french fries (they've nailed the fries-instead-of-homefries thing, they're delicious).",4-star,positive

156,cafes_list,"By far one of my favourite lunch places in Toronto! I used to work just next door, so I'd frequent Avenue at least once a week. Keep in mind that their coffee and desserts are not the best, but I primary go for the sandwiches and soups, and that's what this 5 star rating is based off of. Their most popular sandwich (and my favourite) is the Cajun chicken. It's delicious, and just a little bit spicy. Their wicked Thai chicken soup is one of the best soups I've ever had, but unfortunately they don't make it very often and it varies every day so sometimes you'll need to check back frequently to see what their soup specials are. They also have sandwiches like jerked chicken, Montreal smoked meat, prosciutto, avocado, mushroom, three cheese, lox, etc., and a variety of pizzas, quesadillas, and wraps. The sandwiches comes with a side (Caesar salad, garden salad, coleslaw, or fruit) and totals to about $13 after tax. The sides really aren't very good, so I'd recommend getting the fruit. Overall though, it's a great place to visit if you have a craving for delicious and crafty sandwiches!",5-star,positive

165,cafes_list,"Popped in today for lunch after passing this place a hundred times before. I'm sorry I never tried this place sooner! They have a huge variety of sandwiches - all are the same price: $10.50. I got the special of the day which was Cajun chicken with avocado, lettuce, jalapeno Havarti and some kind of aioli. It was really delicious, but it could have used maybe another minute in the panini press to melt the cheese - so if you like gooey, melty cheese, maybe try asking for it ""well done."" But the flavours were great (not bland at all and very fresh) and I liked that it came with a side salad. I could even choose fruit salad, which made a nice dessert (too much melon, though - but that's always the case.) Only thing that was a bit odd was the extra side of aioli. There was already plenty on the sandwich, so it was unnecessary. A great place to get a gourmet-tasting lunch that can be finished within 30 minutes since you don't have to count on a waiter coming by when you're ready to leave. Comfy, plush chairs, a nice environment - oh and free ice water - which is a really special perk to this place. I have a pet peeve about bottled water, so it felt great to have an endless supply of cold water right there for the taking. This is definitely the best place for lunch in the hospital district.

A quick and easy sandwich/salad sit down cafe with a beautiful, clean aesthetic. The coffee is great and the food is delightful. Try the jerk chicken sandwich and greek salad - order, pay, sit and wait for your food to be brought to you then finish and walk away...that's right, they clean up your plate for you! So be nice, and tip a bit...because except for the ordering at the counter, this place is essentially a sit down cafe and a perfect place for a quick lunch in the neighbourhood.

She did ask if we had other allergies and I mentioned that I'm gluten free. She said they have an awesome gluten free flat bread that can accompany the mezzo plates (tapas style middle eastern dips- we had the baba, labneh, and fried tomatoes (which didn't seem fried, they were more like stewed tomatoes on a plate with extremely spicy wasabi) I asked if I could also get a piece of toast from their menu but on the gluten free bread. The waitress said ""no we don't do that because we don't think it tastes good with that portion of the menu"" it wasn't a ""let me see about it"" or anything, just flat no. I truly cannot imagine why someone else would tell me what they think I would prefer to eat based on their taste palate. It's a local cafe type of restaurant, not anything super upscale where you'd expect it to be a hard set menu. If I'm willing to pay extra to adhere to my allergies, I can't imagine why they wouldn't want to accommodate that. The bread they did bring out that was gluten free was really good and I imagine it would have been amazing as toast! It seemed like a type of pumpernickel with sesame seeds. I was surprised at how small the portion was (four pieces about one inch by four inches to eat three plates of dip with.

183,cafes_list,"I warmed up in B52 with a friend over lunch on a brisk winter day. The two sets of doors keep everyone toasty and eliminate that gust of cold air when people come and go. Our server greeted us upon entering and sat us immediately. The dining area was very clean. The seating was close to other tables to feel intimate, but not close enough to hear their conversations. The kitchen area is open, so we could see the food being prepared. The restaurant has the vibe of being in a friend's kitchen. We both ordered almondmilk maple lattes, each had a little leaf artwork on the top layer. We both ordered the avocado toast, which was on thick grainy bread and heavily drizzled with tahini sauce. My friend ordered the shitakke mushrooms on the bed of kale and I had the lentil soup with preserved lemon (special of the day). Everything was the correct temperature. The serving sizes were just enough: you leave feeling satiated, but not with a doggy bag. The pacing is great for catching up with a friend, mid-work day. I look forward to trying their dessert or brunch next time I visit. B52 makes simply makes delicious vegan food.",5-star,positive
184,cafes_list,"I like the space, I like the location, I like the menu. The staff are nice too. For a place like this in PGH, it's probably hard to justify the pricing. If it's all organic & hand crafted food....people should be happy to pay. Portions are big, food is tasty & ordering is pretty fast I think. The only negatives for me personally are: 1- price is a bit much on certain items 2 - there is a LOT of oil in a lot of the food. The wraps for instance are yummy but they literally DRIP with oil. Seitan is good. Salad is good. Tofu is good...no complaints from this vegan couple.",4-star,positive

The day before we dropped in for coffee/lattes to go. They were excellent. For lunch we had avocado toast, latke, shawarma, roasted cauliflower and coffee drinks again. Everything was delicious. Generous in portions. The wait team was attentive, happy and helpful. Omar, the owner, stopped by and shared a story or 2.

188,cafes_list,"I've eaten here dozens of times now, And I've loved it every time! The breakfast scrambles are very tasty, the greens cooked in garlic and shiitake are a great addition (which you can also get in one of their nice flatbread options), and the potatoes are just on point! Their falafel is amazing whether you prefer the salad or the wrap. The cabbage slaw with lemon gives such a perfect fresh, bright, acidic touch to the tender but crispy and flavorful falafal. I recommend their harissa sauce on everything, it's so good! The coffee has always been yummy, but I'm an even bigger fan of the ""Chic Roja"" rooibos latte! They usually have some flavor of Kombucha on tap and the 3 or 4 times Ive had it ive really enjoyed it. Lastly, their chocolates are awesome little bites to grab on your way out. The place has always been clean, and the staff has always been friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. My only critiques at all would be the sign outside can be easy to miss driving through, and the smaller size of the place which tends to get backed up quickly, but for food that good it's understandable. I highly recommend B52!",5-star,positive
189,cafes_list,"This place was sort of disappointing. They had more on their menu for vegans than just having to throw together a bunch of sides and veggies, so I was initially pumped. I ordered the tofu scramble with brussel sprouts and even my meat ending friend was confused. Everything was cool properly and seasoned well, but the tofu...and it was cubed like in Thai food. Super confusing. The coffee was killer but the food was just meh. I'll give it another shot...but I really don't see what all the hype is about.",3-star,negative

I am not vegan so I wasn't sure what to expect but since my father is a vegetarian I decided to try something new. The spicy sauce they serve with it is delicious.

Apparently, everyone - not just vegetarians and vegans - come to eat here because the food is so good. - Pick 3 Mezze: fried cauliflower (my favorite of the three), Labneh (just okay in my opinion mostly because it wasn't as flavorful as anything else), baba gahnouj (pretty good) - Moussaka (roasted eggplant, cherry tomatoes, kofta, seasonal vegetable, cashew cheese, saffron rice) - yuuuum - Kabob (flame broiled seitan, onion, peppers, zucchini, yogurt cucumber salad, seasonal greens with beets, saffron rice) - again, yuuuum - Carrot cake: Dense cake (yes!), cinnamony (I loved all the cinnamon but my dining companion thought it was on the verge of too much), frosting tasted really good - more like a buttercream than a cream cheese - Maple spice latte: so creamy and delicious - Cafe Rico (almond milk vanilla latte, orange zest, cinnamon): Refreshing flavor because of the citrus but it was one of those drinks where I kept taking sips trying to figure out if I liked it or not! I only had a few sips since it wasn't actually my drink, so I never did figure out where I fell on the citrus-coffee combo! Great atmosphere, friendly and patient service.

So, I was excited to try the food, being open to vegan food because of my egg allergy. We walked right in and were promptly seated by a sweet and casual waitress. They have an espresso bar as well as an impressive list of teas. I elected to try their Americano, and my friend had the mint tea. Both drinks were delicious and the perfect start to a rainy afternoon lunch. For food, I ordered the sautéed shiitake as well as the hummus. Because I eat gluten free I opted for veggies with the hummus, which was an up charge. The kale and mushrooms were very garlicky and full of flavor, and a nice portion. The hummus was creamy and topped with paprika and olive oil. It was delicious, with the veggies or just by itself! My friend ordered a flatbread and added cashew cheese. She let me taste a bite of the the cheese, and it is very smooth and tasty. If I knew what regular cheese tasted like I could better compare the two, but due to being lactose intolerant I leave the cheese tasting to my husband. The service was a little spotty at times and the barista actually had to come get our bills for us, but overall it was a lovely experience and I hope to return soon!",4-star,positive

196,cafes_list,"For the record, I am not vegan. I enjoy eating almost all kinds of food. I came here with my family, some of whom are vegetarians, though not vegan. The food was simply delicious. A quick run-down. We started with a shared 6 Mezze sampler. 1. The hummous was good. I would not say amazing or particularly different, but very good. Certainly better than the container hummous you get in the grocery store. I make my own hummous and not trying to be immodest, but this was as good as mine. 2. The Baba Ghanoush is really excellent. It is much better than any that I have made. It is smoky and has a perfect balance of eggplant and I assume garlic and tahini and lemon. 3. We had a tomato and kale (?) dip that was delicious with Pita. 4. The Falafel were really superb--lighter and more aromatic than most I have had--and I have eaten a lot of falafel in my life. 5. The Labneh was a real surprise. As this is a vegan restaurant, it was not dairy (it is usually like thick spiced greek yogurt/ cheese)--but rather seemed like it was made of a blended cashew butter. 6. The roasted cauliflower was good--just not super distinctive. I did not sample everyone's meal, but I did try mine, and my wife's. A. My Seitan Shawarma Sandwich/Wrap was absolutely superb. It was so delicious. It was actually more delicious and juicy than any kind of Shawarma using Gyro meat I have ever had. B. My wife had the Cashew ""Cheese"" sandwich/wrap. It was surprisingly good - from a marketing perspective it doesn't sound great but the overall effect with the lettuce and spices is delightful. I think that the Cashew Cheese was pretty similar to the Labneh. If you like Mediterranean food you will love this place. If you are Vegan, you will love the fact that B-52 manages to satisfy both those who are looking for dishes that ""fake"" meat dishes, and dishes that celebrate meat free dairy free ingredients in their own right. Go there, enjoy.",5-star,positive
197,cafes_list,"I'm a huge meat eater so i wasn't particularily looking for a vegan place, but the menu looked great so we gave it a try. and OMGGGG was it worth it! We had the seitan shwarma, pick 3 with pita: Labneh, Fried Cauliflower (with garlic and lemon and some crazy delicious sauce), and Fried Tomatos. I cannot begin to describe to you how incredibl and flavorful the Labneh was with just the right amount of mint and extra olive oil drizzled on top. It danced around my mouth and just made me want to smile the whole time i was eating it. I can't wait to bring friends and have them try it! Fried tomatos instantly made me think of fried green tomatoes so when they arrived and it was red tomatoes, I must admit i was disappointed. However misguided my disappointment, they were very tasty and my partner would certainly order it again cuz he scraped that bowl clean with his pita.there was a great drizzle of cream sauce (it might've been tahini but I couldn't put my finger on the flavor amidst the tomatoes) and what appeared to be a drizzle of green tomatoes also. Now, on to my favorite: the fried cauliflower. There's an incredible kick of a spice that screams Middle Eastern cuisine and the best texture from the frying that I've ever had for cauliflower! i'm a stickler for great texture and the crisp seasoned florets with the tender stalks was awesome an was paired with a great creamy sauce (again, might've been tahini with some spice, not 100% sure). To be honest, the worst part was that I ate it so fast that I didn't feel like I have enough of it (I was sharing with my partner)! Not to discount any of these amazing flavors, the seitan schwarma was also incredible. the texture of the romaine and the great pickled turnips went great with the shaved and sesasoned seitan! For the record, ordering a pick 3 and a sandwich was PLENTY for 2 people. probably would've served 3 as we took home half of the sandwich and finished all of the sides instead. We also ordered a chickory root beverage that was unusual but good and the blood orange basil soda. The soda was oustanding, i would probably ask for an extra sprig of basil next time becauses I love basil and could've used just a touch more of it with the orange. Our total bill was $33 plus tax and they included an extra pita at no charge. Dont get me wrong, $40 after tip for lunch for 2 is not inexpensive, but we have another whole lunch another day. You could easily get out of there for less than $10 for lunch if you skip the drink",5-star,positive

The Cashew Cheese flatbread, a smooth and creamy cruelty-free cheese, and at 7 bucks, a great value. Oh, and of course, the fried cauliflower = amazing. I promise you'll gobble it up like you've never gobbled a veggie before. Not to mention the full coffee bar (including nitro coffee!) and delicious baked goods. I'm def partial to the Café Rico and the brownie as my after-meal follow-up. And the house made sodas? So refreshing.

201,cafes_list,"Got the Kofta tofu scramble and it was perfect. Also a ""bottomless"" coffee ($3 on weekends). This place exceeded my expectations. I arrived from out of town, flustered because I don't know the area, traffic was bad and parking difficult (you can parallel park on the street on Sundays, but its tight and just one lane in each direction so you piss off the people behind you). The café is adorable, clean and bright. There was a queue for tables but as I was dining on my own, I was seated at the gorgeous marble counter immediately. They were really busy and I was probably not their ideal guest: party of one, and desperate to get online on my laptop (generally frowned upon in restaurants, especially trendy busy ones) for reasons I won't go into. Suffice it to say I was desperate enough to risk the eyerolls of busy staff..... but at B52 I didn't have to. Everyone was polite and efficient and helpful to a fault.

Huge portion too, although the pita chips were too thick to use as chips, and too hard to break into smaller pieces. Potato-carrot-onion latkes was my favorite. Its like the next level hash brown with lots more ingredients and texture, all fried up. Avocado toast with black seasame was so simple yet so delicious. Chock full of the green mushy stuff yay! Vegan brownie that tasted... very vegan. As in it was OK but the oil taste was apparent... possibly use more coffee or chocolate in their recipe? Sampled their two kombucha of the day, where the the sour vinegar taste was very mild, well masked by the fruity accents. The overall vibe was very hipster, and service was attentive and welcoming.

It's unfortunate -because we used to be regulars but her unsettling attitude has left a bad taste.

The pasta took about 8min to prepare before I walked up to the cash register, where I was informed that their visa AND debit machine were broken and only accepted cash. I asked them why nobody told me when i ordered and she told me they had 2 signs up. I asked them where the sign is and she showed me....the problem with their signage was that it did not say in bold letter CASH ONLY, instead, it was a paragraph explains their debit/visa machine was broken and so they will only be accepting cash payment. The sign was not highlighted or the word cash was not even underlined. I had walked right past the sign without thinking anything of it, that was how not visible their sign were. If both their debit AND visa machines aren't working, I believe their staff have the obligation to inform customers when they do their ordering, so that they don't waste their time like I did. They suggested I go to the bank next door, which I tried, but as I didn't bank with that particular bank, I was asked to pay a $3 convenience charge, which I was not about to pay as it was the restaurants problem, not mine. I ended up walking away without my meal feeling very annoyed having my time wasted. It did not help that the staff were unapologetic and blamed me for missing their puny sign. I will try to add a picture to this review after. Never going back.",1-star,negative
210,cafes_list,"Today, I finally got to have a sit-down meal here after meeting up with my cousin for a brunch meal. We both went for the omelets, you can't go wrong with eggs and toast now can you? And I was right! The omelets are cooked within view of the customers and you get to see the Omelet Maker flip your order with precision. My order of ham and cheese omelet with mushrooms and toast with a side of roasted potatoes (at additional charge) filed up the plate on which they were placed and turned out tasty. Alot of the ready-made food like salads and sandwiches are also invitingly display in their respective stations. The delicious looking cakes are also well-displayed but there is not an overwhelming selection of them so that makes it easy to take your picks from the sweet choices. There's even a cute-looking bunch of gingerbread cookies among the display for this festive season. And there's an eye-catching nifty row of mugs with the Bakery Garden logo displayed on the shelves behind the counter of pastries. The moderately sized cafe is spacious enough for customers to move around while looking at the food and reading the menus. There is also enough seating inside so that the place doesn't get too filled-up with patrons. My cousin and I were there around 12pm and the cafe was getting busy enough but there was still room to move around without bumping into anyone, and we were able to get a table for the two of us.

The smoked salmon also did not taste fresh even when cooked. Plus, I thought the idea of eating smoke salmon was having it raw, but the Cook basically fried it and overcooked it. What we received was scrambled salmon eggs for 11.95! It looked really unappetizing. The biggest concern I had was when the Cook handled raw meat before touching our bread, etc. ~ we requested refund afterwards for our food. Wanted to order their juices, but could tell they were not up to code standards when they kept it in a bucket instead of using the fridge - stacking cups on top of one another! The funny thing is, they put fruits and veggies in the fridge where the drinks use to be. Really odd that they are using the fridge like a display cabinet. I have been at this location many times before and it was never like this; and it seems like with the change of new Owners, I hope it's because they are still sorting things out and things aren't permanently this way.

When I was younger, this place was bigger with more to choose from. It halfed in size when Senses came to the Village of Bayview and then that space continued to be occupied by businesses other than the Bakery Garden. Total memory lane here... they used to have a huge oven and made the world's best bruschetta with melted cheese on it. *drooool* My first impression of this place was ... C H A O S. You're not really sure where to line up or where the line starts. The ratio of customer to employee was like 50:1. Chaos makes me very tired. There are quite a few tables with only one gentleman in charge of the cleaning of it. Obviously he can't clean all of them within minutes so when walking around and looking for a place to sit, many of the tables looked disgustingly dirty. The food was 'meh.' I ordered the vegetable barley soup, which is apparently low in fat and low in calories. It was bland, but this might be due to the fact that its lacking in yummy fat. Who knows. For an additional $0.43, you could get a very stale piece of challah bread. I should have been paid the forty-three cents to eat it imo.

219,cafes_list,"I visited this restaurant on July 6, 2011 and found the experience quite frustrating. There is no clear signage as to where to place an order, so I ended up standing at the sandwich counter for several minutes while being ignored by the staff. I finally decided to walk down to the cashier at the back of the restaurant to inquire as to where I should be placing an order, and she hastily directed me back to the sandwich counter. I returned and managed to get the attention of one of the staff and placed an order for a soup & sandwich. I was soon handed a bowl of soup, but no tray. I looked around in the vacinity for a tray, and had to ask where they were. They were back by the cashier. Odd, but ok. I put the soup down, retrieved a tray, came back, and waited for the sandwich. When it was all ready to go, I went back to the cashier and paid after she had messed up my drink order several times, which did nothing to improve her mood. I looked around and found a table, only to realize I hadn't been given any utensils. I looked around the tray area for spoons, but couldn't find one. I went back to the now clearly aggrivated cashier and asked her for one, and she directed me to a spot obscured in a corner behind the cashier and drink cooler. All in all, there was no signage, and the layout of the ordering/trays/cashier/utensil station was only apparent if you're used to coming here or a member of the staff. The portion size was quite large, but I didn't want to pester the already annoyed staff with a request for to go packaging. The staff was rude and inattentive.

The staff is fantastic and the place is super clean. We will definitely be going back. The prices were really good too. Low prices for fixed incomes is fantastic. I cant wait to eat there again, and i will.",5-star,positive

230,cafes_list,"Cute decor in this bright attractive little restaurant. It is located at the front of a medical building facing Thunderbird Avenue and directly across the street from a bowling alley This restaurant is a great find! Quality food in a convenient location. Friendly service here, they actually remember their customers. I liked my breakfast of bacon, eggs, home fries plus great coffee! For lunch I drop by for my favorite sandwich, the BLT, that uses great applewood cured bacon. Daily specials encourage trying new dishes. Like the chili with delicious cornbread. Lemon cheesecake is definitely a winner! Just the right consistency with fresh lemon flavor. Can't wait until the owner/chef prepares it again!",5-star,positive
231,cafes_list,"The food here is really really good! I had the Cuban sandwich with the fries. The pork shoulder in the sandwich was melting in my mouth with every bite. The bread was toasted perfectly and had great crunch to it. The fries there have this amazing seasoning and are very flavorful.

234,cafes_list,"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. They really try to accommodate all kinds of diets and most meal choices are healthy options. Main dishes are $5-5.50 and sides are $1-2, so it's really reasonably priced. And definitely check for their Hooked deal, it's a 50% off discount, which means you can eat there for around 3 bucks.",5-star,positive

It's a great student - run place and they do listen to the feedback you may leave! Sometimes they have Hooked as well. If you're in with a sweet tooth, grab their delicious cookies or 7-layer bar. My fave!",4-star,positive
236,cafes_list,Hands down one of my favorite lunch spots on our campus. They have a clearly well-crafted menu with quality ingredients and the price is very economical.

237,cafes_list,"Nothing says awesome more than one dollar cookie. Especially when that cookie is as big as your head. When you're looking to eat cheap. When you're looking for an AMAZING meal. When you're looking for something on South Campus, even if you're NOT a student, head to Bevier Cafe. You've never had a dorm food experience like it, I promise you. The only reason this place loses a star is because... despite it's upscale menu and the quality of the food they put out, it _is_ still a dorm cafe. There's not much to be done for a building that was built in the fifties, so you eat in a place that consistently reminds you of that office setting in Joe vs the Volcano, but still. You'll never eat better!",4-star,positive
238,cafes_list,"Bevier cafe has significantly improved in 2013. There is much more consistency in the preparation, seasoning, and portioning of dishes. Orange chicken is still too sweet and syrupy, but overall, the quality of food is much better than before.",4-star,positive
239,cafes_list,"Ever since I discovered it a couple of months ago, I have practically been living here. It's a nice cross between a fancy restaurant and a cheap cafeteria. There are always at least a few dishes to pick from, rotating daily. They also have a house salad and Greek salad every day. They charge $5 for (practically) every entree, which is sometimes too much, sometimes too little for the dish. On the other hand, all sides are $0.75, so it all kind of evens out. They also have rotating desserts, but always have big, soft, fresh cookies. Although going through the line to pay with your tray feels like a cafeteria, the seating is basic, but very nice, wooden, and pretty comfortable. You sit with a number and relax and wait for your dishes to be brought to you--which usually isn't too long. They do serve breakfast, but I haven't been able to try it yet. The convenience of being able to check the menu on the website pushes the score to an A+!",5-star,positive

241,cafes_list,"This place is solid. It's cheap, especially for campus. The menu varies day to day, which keeps things interesting. You probably won't love every dish they make, but there's little displays so you have a pretty good idea what you're getting. The prices have increased a little from what other reviews say, to $5 an entree for lunch and $0.75 for sides. But I think it is usually worth that. Some things I've had here: Pastrami on marbled rye: was quite tasty. Maybe not quite as flavorful as the Beef Stand, but cheaper and closer for me. Fried okra: is the best I've had in town. Yum. FSHN chips sandwich: I was a little disappointed in this one - there seemed to be less fish than breading. Beer battered cod and chips - was pretty good. Mushroom and turkey panini - also pretty good, and satisfying on a cold day. Manhattan clam chowder: I liked this a lot, it had a tasty broth and many chunks of fish. I'll have to try the soups more often. Overall: since there are multiple dishes, it seems like there's usually at least one thing worth trying. I've never had the salads or desserts, but they look pretty good. Service has been good every time I went, though obviously this depends a bit on the students working. I've been pretty happy with the food, I kinda like the cafeteria style set-up, and the price is right. I'll be coming back here to try out more of the menu. Great for a day when you forgot your lunch or just need a break and some tasty grub. Since I found it, it has become one of my regular lunch spots.

I also had the South Western Fiesta Turkey and Corn Salad and the daily special- which was Chicken Gumbo. It all cost about $11 which is more than I was expecting to pay but I was very full. The Salad was great. And I NEVER like salads. I generally go out of my way to pay extra for an alternative but I noticed that the salad today looked pretty good and I was glad I made that choice. It was chock full of fresh vegetables, juicy chicken, and great taste! The salads here are wayy bigger than the entrees. I was not impressed with the Gumbo. I can't put a finger on it but I have to say that the overall flavor was not appealing...",4-star,positive
243,cafes_list,"It's convenient. It's cheap. Dessert is always good, and again cheap, so I only feel guilty for being overindulgent, not for spending too much money. The menu rotates and there is always a vegetarian option. You order your food, you pick up salad (if you must) and dessert (you must) and get your drink. Sit down and a cheerful student delivers your hot entree to your table. And I don't have to go outside to get there. Bonus!",4-star,positive
244,cafes_list,"When I read the positive reviews on Yelp, I expected to fall in love with Bevier Cafe. After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends, the good news is that I don't dislike the place. We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed, and they were out of some of their entrees. The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while, and it wasn't as tasty as I anticipated. Also, their service seems kind of disorganized--you take a tray, tell the people at the counter what you want, pay for it, go sit down with an empty tray, and then the employees bring you your food. Couldn't they just hand the food over the counter? Or just have real servers? Even with the not-as-good-as-expected food and the confusing service, I like the concept of Bevier Cafe. I'm happy to support a student/university-run restaurant, and I will eat there again.",3-star,negative

248,cafes_list,"I ma having a continued, ridiculous love affair with Bevier Cafe. You see, I have a class from 11-12 in Bevier Hall, and the cafe itself is exactly one floor below my classroom. Did I mention I get out at noon? When lunch is served? Yeah, you do the math. It's a damn good thing that B.C. is relatively cheap ($4.50 for a major entree, or sandwich), or I'd be broke and panhandling in front of the place at this rate. The Food Service students run a fantastic local cafe that helps them get hands on experience and gets me lunch time eatin' on the cheap. There's always a vegetable side, some mouthwatering dessert, and the space is cheery and pleasant if a bit utilitarian. Bevier's well worth the visit. That said, it's basically cafeteria style in that you pick up a tray, select your food options, add on bread, dessert, drinks, etc, then pay for your meal. They'll give you a number, and a smiling food service student will bring you your food--often eerily promptly. Now, my only request is that you don't crowd up the place when i come charging in all hungry like. Cuz that's not cool. But go check out the cafe, with a fantastic array of food orders (and a daily changing menu!), you're bound to be satisfied.",5-star,positive

They also offer portable coffee mugs for $10 with $.50 refills for an eternity after! take that, espresso royale!! on my graduate student budget, it sure makes me warm and gooey inside to know that i can get real food (and the elixir of life- coffee!) at such an affordable price and in a convenient location. sure beats my made in 30 seconds pbj for lunch!",4-star,positive

I haven't even mentioned there delicious donuts. Freshly made every day. Fruity pebbles donut - you can't go wrong. It's a bit tucked away in the arrowhead grill plaza.

We tried a few more donuts but the tiger tail reigned supreme, I don't think any other donut was liked as much as the tiger tail.

In addition their prices are perfect for their menu. Our total cost for all the above less than $18.00! Their glazed, buttermilk bar, and peanut & chocolate cake donuts were fresh & delicious! The breakfast bagels with cheese, eggs, and bacon were on large, fresh, and soft bagels. Also, unlike some bagel places in town, the egg (flavorful & fluffy) & bacon part of your breakfast bagel is proportionate to the size of the bagel. Love that! Our drinks were tasty! The hot chocolate was hot & ""chocolaty."" The Thai tea was delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect as it was an orange colored drink. I found out that the tea leaves used for this drink are orange in color and when added to the 1/2 & 1/2 it turns an interesting orange color. Not a big place nor an extensive menu. However, what they do have is fantastic. Next time we will try their array of breakfast burritos. Great family run business! We will definitely be back... often!",5-star,positive
261,cafes_list,Happy people who connect with the customer. Did I mention they are serving delicious donuts? What's not to like? A display case filled with an array of delicious sweet love.

The other burritos have potato so I appreciate them offering a higher protein option. Veggies were fresh and flavorful and ham was good.

The bagel was practically the same size as my husband's huge man hands. We got one that came with eggs, cheese, sausage and bacon. Very filling! The eggs seemed like maybe poured/liquid eggs but they were cooked well and didn't have that fake taste like poured eggs usually do. The burrito was really tasty, and I loved that it was not at all greasy. If I had to pick something to critique, I wish the potatoes had been crispy (they're more like just blanched), but they were still tasty. Service was super friendly and fast. I think they heard me mention it was warm in the seating area - I wasn't complaining, more of just an observation- but minutes later the AC came on :-) that was nice. Staff was hustling to keep coffee brewed and make sure no one had to wait long. Overall, a surprisingly good find in this little corner of Peoria!",4-star,positive

287,cafes_list,"Mauritius is a tiny (Mississauga-sized) island in the Indian ocean, but it's actually quite interesting with a storied past and beautiful vistas. I haven't been to Mauritius yet (my fiancee is from there), but if the Blue Bay Cafe is even a half decent representation of the food there, I will love it! I thought it would be a fun surprise to take my fiancee here on her birthday, and she wasn't expecting it at all! It's pretty awesome that we have a Mauritian restaurant in Canada, given that Mauritius' population is barely over 1 million, and even better that it is really good. I've given away my bottom line, sure, but I wasn't expecting this place to be this good. It's very Toronto (I'm from the burbs), so small, quaint and very non-corporate (all good things I suppose) as well non-trendy. It's like, real, man. We ordered the crevette au couer de palmiste (shrimp served with tangy palm hearts) for her, and I ordered the carri ourite (octupus curry). Both of these came with rice and two kinds of chutneys. The shrimp dish wasn't bad at all. The shrimp, not bad in portion was well-cooked and flavourful, but the palm hearts lacked discernible taste and the sauce they were in was bland as well. My fiancee really regretted not ordering the octopus (we usually order different dishes to be able to sample more) since she loves her mom's octopus curry, but more so because it was absolutely fantastic! This dish was the showstopper, the dish you go to this restaurant for. Octopus is a difficult protein to cook right. Unlike other kinds of seafood, you don't just cook it fast & high and simply make sure you don't overcook it. Octopus needs to stew... for a while. It goes from just tender (when its not really cooked) to hard to tender again at some point in the cooking process, and you will find that most places do not do it right. The Blue Bay cafe does. The curry itself was just delicious, and even now, after much time has passed, the flavour lingers on in my mind, beckoning. You don't need to worry about what Mauritian food is or isn't, or whether you'll like it. Like a restaurant of the highest grade, the people at the back of the Blue Bay cafe really care about their food, and it shows. This is what all restaurants should be like... good food, served without fuss.",5-star,positive

Lil Man always gets a large watermelon slushie with Boba. And I always get mango slushie with biba, but today, I asked for extra Boba and got it. It tasted so much better with the extra boba. It is so easy to get to the shop because it is in the Target plaza right there on the corner of Silverado and Eastern. next to the shop is other shops such as hot dogs, chicken, and much more.",4-star,positive

295,cafes_list,I'm sorry but the Taro Boba and the Green tea boba sucked so bad. Yuck. I swear that green tea boba looked brown as hell. Never coming here again I swear. I had better taro and green tea boba. Well at lease I know now. Boba drinks are more popular in California and they taste better out there too. Oh well.,1-star,negative
296,cafes_list,Great catering and great place to host a party. I've had food from bravo bistro on numerous occasions and every time all my guests really enjoyed it. It's also very reasonably priced.,5-star,positive
297,cafes_list,"Stopped in here for lunch on a business trip. My local colleagues recommended this place, said it was fantastic. I couldn't agree more. It's a homemade lunch and comfortable seating. Beats a fast food stop hands down! I had the pork schnitzel, mashed potatoes with gravy and my favorite part was the fennel corn romaine lettuce salad. Wish I could get that recipe!!! If anyone know what goes into that in addition please message me!!",5-star,positive
298,cafes_list,"This place is one of my favorite lunch spots. Its clean, nicely done and servers are polite. Their perogies are sooo delicious .. its like one sure thing that I order every time. Along with that, the roasted potatoes are sooo nicely spiced and yummy. I don't really like their main dishes much though. So, I usually just end up ordering the combo of 3 sides or 4 sides.",4-star,positive
299,cafes_list,"I love perogies so I came here pretty often for lunch when I worked in Mississauga. They have a ton of other things for you to eat though as it is a Polish + Italian type restaurant. My co-workers often got the fish and they also enjoyed it a lot. As a side we always got potatoes which we really enjoyed. If you get like a main item + the 2 sides it's actually quite a lot of food. The food also tastes fairly ""homecooked"" to me. The service is always pretty fast as you basically shuffle across as if you're in a cafeteria. The parking lot is huge so you should not have trouble finding parking even during peak lunch hours.",5-star,positive

309,cafes_list,"Best boba place I've been to hands down. Every time I go here, I have never been disappointed. From the quality of the boba, to the staff, to the environment, it is all great. The staff is always so open to showing me drinks that aren't on the menu such as the ""hokiyoki"" which is half of the Hokkaido milk tea and half of the Okinawa milk tea. I would recommend my favorite to try but every drink I've tried here has never disappointed me so I know it won't disappoint you!",5-star,positive

I tried two drinks and the tea was perfect and made to your level of sweetness and the guy... who I think is the owner was super friendly, helpful, and just warm. So of course I came back on Sunday for 3 drinks! While I'm from out of town, this will be my new regular spot when I am back in town... thanks for an awesome experience 5+ stars! Keep it up!",5-star,positive
311,cafes_list,"Welllll... my burp smelled like flowers. That's cuz the tea is real; organic, authentic, fragrant, not in stapled bleached baggies type of tea. I saw lavender on the menu and I inquired if they make Lavender Latte. They can! With their sea salt cream apparently - only found at Brew Tea Bar. Was specified as ""our sea salt cream"" several times. Sounds super official. Except made with whole milk. No, says my tummy. Bummed just a pinch, cuz I was loving the sound of that. I was still able to have the Lavender with almond milk. It's only available hot or iced. Blended sounds more summery though, right? It's okay! Got it with Level 4 sweetness. Very awesome! Nice gesture - the tall young lady even asked me, using my first name, how I liked it. I LOVED IT! Please forgive me for not acknowledging the tall lady's name. She should know who she is. Very helpful and sort of educating me on how their tea orders are prepared. Superb customer service on her part. She even informed me of the wait for brewing time. Crepes on the menu! See... this is how to retain customers by offering variety and a reason to stay. They have so much traffic in here that I had to tell them they need more space! Guess what tea butt? They're opening another location. You probably knew that. But heyyyyy...",5-star,positive
312,cafes_list,"This is the best tea place I've ever been to!

Plus the owners are very good to their employees!",5-star,positive
313,cafes_list,My only place I like to go to for always fresh boba. They adjust the sweetness to your taste preference. They even exchange a drink that my son wasn't too sure about with no problem. And they have a stamp card for free boba after purchasing 10 and I definitely buy lots of drinks here.,5-star,positive
314,cafes_list,"My family and I love Brew Tea Bar! It's my kids' favorite after school ""go-to"" place whenever we want something to tie us over until dinner. Between the seven of us, we've tried slushes, teas, coffees, hot/cold...and crepes! Everything is great! And the workers are friendly, fast, and efficient!",5-star,positive
315,cafes_list,"This place is really great! I initially ordered the Almond Milk Tea with boba but after trying it, I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. My friend pointed to a sign that said you can get your drink remade at no charge. My drink was remade into an Okinawa Milk Tea as a recommendation by Chris. After he gave me the drink he made sure I liked it before leaving. Overall good drink and service!",5-star,positive
316,cafes_list,"Love Brew Tea bar! I have seen it many times before I decided to try it, I always order what they recommend. I usually get the coffee latte with sea salt Carmel and sometimes boba. (You can order half sweet too.) I feel like cheers when I go there now, I guess I like them a lot! I have also tried the black tea and the Rose milk tea, someday I will get through the whole menu.",5-star,positive
317,cafes_list,"I remember seeing the Brew Tea Bar when it first opened and thinking it looked interesting. When I read reviews, I knew I had to try this place, and I was not disappointed. My boyfriend and I ordered two slushes and two crepes. Even though the cafe had a line out the door, our order was delivered to us in around 5 minutes. I was very impressed! I ordered the Taro Slush with boba and lychee jelly. It was amazing! The slush even came with fresh taro on the top. The cashier asked me how sweet I wanted it, which I think is a nice consideration. I also decided on a crepe with my favorite type of ice cream in it: green tea. It was delicious! I can't wait to come back here and try out more of their menu. I'm so happy to find an amazing boba place so close to my house.",5-star,positive
318,cafes_list,"This place never fails to blow my mind. Thank you so much for kindness and recommendations. My mom and I have come in before and wanted something different. So we got a coffee milk tea with less sweetener for her, and it's perfect if you want more of the coffee taste, and you can definitely still taste the tea in it. My Thai milk tea is delicious. Oh the boba too, so fresh!!! I think they make in house? Taste like it!!! So worth the half hour drive. FYI any of the ice teas are bomb. I've tried basically all of them, and the mango is always a winner.",5-star,positive
319,cafes_list,"This is my favorite boba tea place and believe you me that I have drank a whole lotta boba teas in my life. This place has the best boba ever (in Las Vegas, LA and they are even better than some of the boba tea places in Asia) Their boba has always been consistent, service is almost always impeccable (especially if the senior staffs are around). The drinks are nice, service is excellent and they use really good tea! I wish they would stay open a little later than 10pm though. Definitely recommend for everyone who loves boba tea.",5-star,positive
320,cafes_list,Hokkaido milk tea is amazingggg. The employees (owners?) are very friendly and efficient. Will continue to come back for more and more!,5-star,positive
321,cafes_list,"After trying their tea for the first time, I came back 2 more times within a few days, bringing different people each time... Which never happens. Everything I tried was very good (I took some sips from my family members or friends), but I especially loved the Hokkaido milk tea which I tried for the first time there. The tea itself had a strong flavor and balance to it, and the boba wasn't too sweet for my taste. I like that they have stamp cards and the staff is very accommodating, will definitely stop by whenever I'm craving boba.",5-star,positive
322,cafes_list,"This boba shop has the best sea salt lattes in town. My personal favorite is the smokey oolong latte. Soooo good! I dont know what else to say about it other than it beats out the other tea lattes here in Vegas. The tea doesnt taste even one second over-brewed. Its perfectly time to where theres not a hint of bitterness in any of the teas. The crepes too are delicious but the star is truly the tea. The interior is simple but still nice. Theres seating inside and out. Looks clean from what i can see and no problems with the bathrooms. Brew tea bar staff are friendly and attentive. They are well trained for the most part. I would say this is my favorite boba shop because their tea is perfectly brewed, everything is fresh, and good customer service. Oh and also, they have crepes, hehe. Come through if you want quality milk tea!",5-star,positive
323,cafes_list,"Under new management I believe.. Which is a plus because the guy who used to work here before would literally try to talk to you for 30 minutes if you let him. Anyways, great flavors and really quick service now. Inside decor is beautiful and warm. I love that they add in a scoop of taro in their taro slush boba (my favorite flavor to order) Good prices and they offer a stamp card as well.",5-star,positive

325,cafes_list,"Sou has a goldmine! This place is usually busy and with good reason! Their teas are incredible and the staff is amazing. I don't know how he does it with the volume of customers but, somehow Sou remembers your name and order every time! Never a bad experience! If you love Boba like I do...Brew Tea Bar is a place you need to check out!",5-star,positive
326,cafes_list,I rave about this place to all my friends but haven't had time to write a review. This is one of my favorite places to get some lavender milk tea. They do such a great job and brew it fresh. The boba is also excellent and not mushy. I recommend coming here if you enjoy milk teas they have a large selection of loose tea that they brew to order.,5-star,positive
327,cafes_list,"One of the best places in the city to get iced and milk teas! I'm here too often, to be honest. It's one of my favorite spots. The staff is always very friendly and helpful, and will make drinks exactly how you like them. Their drinks never disappoint! The boba is perfect: not too chewy or hard, slightly sweet but not overwhelming. My favorite milk teas are the Hokkaido and the Caramel. The Hokkaido isn't too sweet and has a creamy flavor. The Caramel is more on the sugary side but the flavor is rich. The iced teas are always refreshing, but sometimes a little too fruity and similar tasting to each other. The flavorings tend to dull out the tea taste. For their coffee, it's pretty strong so caffeine lovers rejoice! It's good with the sea salt cream. Drinks are made quickly, so even though parking can get busy sometimes it's easy to pop in and out. The interior is kind of small and there's only like three tables and a bench. Overall a really great tea bar!",5-star,positive
328,cafes_list,"Okay, I really don't get it. I got a hot lavender milk tea; why was it greasy tasting?! My lid was broken so when it came time to drink my tea, the hot drink spilled all over me. Since the drink was greasy, getting the stain off my jacket was no walk in the park, and it needed to be washed a few times. Perhaps I ordered a bad drink, I might be willing to give this place another shot since my classmate loves it here so much, but my first impression was not a good one at all.",2-star,negative
329,cafes_list,"I don't think words can describe how much I love Brew Tea Bar! What makes it even better is that it's only a couple minutes away from my house! I literally go here every day, it's pretty embarrassing.. On my first visit, I ordered the Honey Milk Tea with honey boba and pudding, which was alright. I also tried their caramel slushy (I don't' know exactly what it's called) but it was waaaay too sweet for me. My boyfriend then introduced me to my favorite drink, Hokkaido Milk Tea with honey boba (also good with grass jelly) !!! I'm so in love with this drink, you have no idea! It's all I ever get and I refuse to drink anything else, because it's THAT good. If you like milky drinks like I do, then I highly recommend getting the Hokkaido Milk Tea! I recommend trying their crepes as well! Not only is their boba perfect, but they also have excellent customer service! I love how they are willing to adjust your drink to your liking. I also love how the employees remember me and my boyfriend! We come here so often that sometimes they give us a large instead of a regular drink, which is AWESOME! This place just has really chill vibes and a friendly environment. I don't think I'll ever go to another boba place, because this is honestly the best one we have in Vegas.",5-star,positive
330,cafes_list,"What more can you ask for when a boba place has delicious drinks and exceptional customer service? Brew Tea Bar has become one of my go-to spots for when I'm craving some boba. It's close to my house and serves my favorite milk tea flavor, rose. The rose milk tea is phenomenal and definitely tastes even better with their honey boba. A specialty that Brew Tea Bar serves is the milk tea latte: a tea of your choice as the base infused with sea salt creamer. It might sound a whole lot of weirdness at first, but give it a try! I personally loved the black tea latte. I've also tried their passion fruit green tea with less sugar and Hokkaido milk tea which were both good. They ensure that you are satisfied with your drink before you leave their place, or they will gladly replace you with another drink. They also allow you to select your sugar level and provide great recommendations whenever you're stuck on what to order. I will continue on my visit to Brew Tea Bar, keep up the great work!",5-star,positive

The meals that we had ordered included the hash browns, when the food arrived at the table the hash browns were luke warm at best. We informed the staff, and they brought us a small plate of fresh hash browns right away. They were equally as cold. None of the staff came back to see if we were satisfied. . . . The rest of the meal was adequate, but certainly not worth what we paid. The Americano coffee was pretty good. The whole place is looking pretty tired, and needs a good facelift and cleaning, and some fresh water in the mop bucket would go a long ways when cleaning the bathroom floors. Best to spend your money somewhere else.",1-star,negative
336,cafes_list,"Stopped in for a lunch hour break with 2 colleagues. Cadence is a reliable resto with good food, but I have not been in years. Two of us ordered a traditional breakfast with eggs, potatoes and sausage and one of us had the burger. The sausage was a little sweet and boring and the potatoes were not really browned so they lacked some crispiness I was expecting. Overall the food was good, but I'd like to see them kick it up with an exceptional meat and crispy spuds. It was a warm day and it was HOT inside the resto. They could have had a few fans to move the air around. The resto has a vintage coffee house feel, but also feels a bit grubby and worn. The staff at the counter were not terribly interested in anything but their own conversation. I hate it when I feel like I'm putting them out because I'm placing my order. Food *** Service ** Atmosphere ***",3-star,negative

Seating can be hard to find at peak times (because the locals know best!), so better to go early. They have a picnic table out back which is nice to eat at on sunny days. A simple, no fuss diner with friendly staff and good food! I always LOVE going to Cadence. Update : my last two visits have not been as pleasant. Food has been going downhill as of late. Unsure if it is a new Chef or what but very disappointing.",2-star,negative
338,cafes_list,Haven't been here in awhile and certainly won't go back. The food wasn't bad but the price was shocking. $9 for a bowl of soup and a bun? Seriously??? I was stunned when the food was delivered to our table. I would say we got a cup and a half of soup at most. My friend had a sandwich for $14. At least she didn't leave hungry like I did. Left feeling completely ripped off. Sorry Cadence but I am done with you once and for all.,1-star,negative
339,cafes_list,"I enjoyed my experience here this morning. I had the ""Traditional Breakfast"" with sausage, poached eggs, hashbrowns & rye toast. Everything was fresh and properly prepared.

I will eat here again.",4-star,positive
340,cafes_list,"I like diners and they're few and far in between in Calgary nowadays. This place is set up cafeteria style - order (eggs benny!), pay, grab a number and (hopefully) find a table.

And there's no reason it shouldn't be - food's decent (the hashbrowns could be more crisp), service is efficient and it's clean.",4-star,positive

There was! The breakfast huevos rancheros is amazing! The coffee is excellent (finally a place that knows how to make coffee!), the carrot cake is delish and so much more. We've been there several times now and it will always be a cozy, funky place to go and eat. What a great find for Bowness!",4-star,positive

343,cafes_list,"Cadence moves at a good pace. Service is friendly and quick. They have daily specials which I'll come back to check out - but this time I stuck with the classic breakfast. Standard fare, but eggs were a bit undercooked - I'd order one hardness level more next time. Inside the dining area is spacious for a breakfast place and the background music isnt overwhelming for conversation. The tables -of which there are 9 - had reasonable turnover, and there is more than enough counter seating if in a group of two or solo. Many people ordered breakfast to go and they didn't wait long before they could be on their way. Coffee here is very good - even just a standard cup of joe was great. If i lived in Bowness I'd come back just for that. Overall I would recommend this for a decent standard breakfast place and will come back next time I'm in the area.",4-star,positive
344,cafes_list,"We have lived in Bowness for over a year and honestly drove by this place so many times. Little did we know until today what a treasure it is! The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was so reminiscent of my native Vancouver in earlier years. We both ordered Huevos Rancheros which were amazing! Sorry, we forgot to take a photo because we were so busy just taking it all in. My partner is Mexican and although this is not how Huevos Rancheros are made in Mexico, he also said these were fabulous! Unlike another reviewer who reported them to be cold and dried out, these were hot, fresh and absolutely delicious. We love our coffee and it's rare to have us say that the coffee was good ~ It was!! All in all, this is our new haunt for late breakfast or brunch and, we can't wait to try the burgers and other fare. By the way, we arrived at 11:45 so it was super busy and still everything arrived quickly! We will go back for sure!",5-star,positive
345,cafes_list,"very good coffee, but breakfasts are horrible there, avoid the huevos rancheros the refritos were dried out on the stale tortilla and eggs were cold by the time they served them.

The coffee was decent and I always love places that serve Mighty Leaf tea, which Cadence does. Like Vendome, this place requires you to order at the counter, find a table and the staff will bring you your order. It gets really busy and we could barely find a free table since it seemed like most people went there to meet up with friends and family to chat for a long time over breakfast and a cup of coffee. I can see why Cadence is a neighborhood gem and its a good place to try if you're ever in the area.",4-star,positive

349,cafes_list,"I quite liked this little cafe for breakfast.We went at 10am on a Sunday and it was busy but not too busy that we had to wait to long. The cafe itself almost looks 50 and the decor is very cool. Apon entering the cafe you order your breakfast, coffees ect at the till and then you are given a number and you can go find any table you want and they will deliver your food out to you (drinks you have to pick up at the counter). The food was fairly good as well - no complaints. I ordered the benny and asked for my eggs poached hard and they came out that way which was a bonus (alot of the time at other places they don't when I order it) The only downside was nobody ever came up to us after getting our food to check on us - I'm not sure if this is just something they don't do or if they were too busy. Either way it was a decent experience here.",3-star,negative

But there's always a few things that leave me wanting just a little bit more. Many of the sandwiches come with under-seasoned and undercooked hashbrowns. And today the toast in my club sandwich came out cold and way too crunchy. It basically shredded the roof my mouth to pieces, and I felt like i was eating a grenade of razor blades. But the ingredients were so fresh and the sandwich so well constructed that I still enjoyed it. It's so close to being a great place. I think the employees need to just care a little more (they kind of act like they're too cool to be there), and they'll have a home run.",4-star,positive

Food is average and everything is over-priced. Skip this place and go somewhere else.",1-star,negative
355,cafes_list,"Only been here for breakfast/brunch and it was great. I had an omelet and my friend the traditional type of breakfast(eggs,toast,bacon etc) and both looked and tasted great.

356,cafes_list,"I love Cadence. A long time resident of Bowness, I had been longing for a ""real"" coffee shop - one that would make something a bit more inventive than just drip coffee (read: lattes, espresso, etc.) - since I was in high school. Then along came Cadence. I don't stop in nearly as often as I'd like, but when I do, it's always fantastic. The coffee - both brewed and espresso-based - is rich and delicious, the food is scrumptious, the pies are HUGE and the staff are friendly and provide quick service, even during the morning rush. Altogether, the location, atmosphere, decor, service, food/drink and overall vibe adds something to my neighbourhood that I love.

There are fresh baked goods made every morning in their ovens, but if you want something more substantial there are plenty of options. I had the breakfast bagel and was asked my preference of bagel, cheese, and toppings. There was the standard toasted bagel (and not the giant kind, the normal size!), tomato, cheese, etc but the addition of alfalfa sprouts kept it fresh and light. Overall? If you have flexibility with your locations for coffee/breakfast meetings make the effort to meet someone there. They'll have a full stomach and a great mood to match!",5-star,positive
359,cafes_list,"Cadence is a cafe that marches to its own beat. This little fixture in Bowness is best described as a coffee shop with a distinct diner flare. From the red walls and metal accents to the checkered floors and the retro diner stools at the counter, Cadence is a funky little joint to come for breakfast, lunch, or just a coffee. I walked in on a Saturday morning and the place was hopping, but I didn't have to wait long to place my order at the counter for an Americano and date square to go. While waiting, I had a chance to peruse the menu on the chalkboard, and observe many happy noshers clearly pleased with their orders. My Americano was seriously one of the best I've had in Calgary, and the date square was just right as an accompaniment. I'm definitely going to revisit this cool neighbourhood hangout for a meal next time. This place is cool beans, man.",5-star,positive
360,cafes_list,"Way overpriced but delicious. $26.85 for an omlette, egg-witch, and one coffee. The breakfast menu isn't really anything unique. Various types of eggs, egg-wiches, meat, and veg options. The eggs were good (but not as good as farm fresh), the bread was fresh, but in proportion to cost and inspiration of the menu, this place ain't much. Considering this places costs double a breakfast at a cheap diner in Toronto's Queen West (where real estate is double) yet only slightly better, I'm not going to give this place more than 2 stars. Service is pretty weak. It's self service yet they have a tip jar at the cashier and the debit machine asks if the payer would like to tip. I really dislike that sense of entitlement. They aren't rude, and I don't demand some bubbly idiot in a short skirt to ask me how my day is going, but, despite staffers hanging out behind the bar we were sitting at, they never said obligatory customer service remarks such as: ""thanks"", ""may i bring you anything"", ""may i refill your coffee"", and ""how was this meal?"". I even asked one for tobasco and she pointed at the condiment table at the other end. This place has the potential to give something unique but they just keep it simple for the lowest common denominator. I'm worried that our city is turning into vancouver.",2-star,negative
361,cafes_list,"Cadence is probably the best coffee shop in Bowness. It's right on Bowness Road so you can't miss it if you're in the area. It's the perfect little diner/cafe to stop in and have a java or a sandwich. It may be a little pricey for a coffee shop, but I think it's totally worth it. It's just a very interesting place to sit around in for a couple of hours, read your book, or chat with some locals. It almost seems like Cadence is a bit out of place in Bowness, but it works perfectly. I find it odd, however, that it is only open until 4pm weeknights and 3pm on Sunday. It would seem like they could make so much better business if they would stay open a little longer. I really enjoy Cadence for what it is, a cute cafe diner. If ever I'm in dire need of coffee and am in the Bowness area, Cadence is where I go.",4-star,positive

365,cafes_list,"So, just so everyone knows, this place recently underwent significant changes. No more $6.50 all day menu. Most of the reviews here are referring to the old setup and menu of this restaurant. The former owners of King & I on Maryland are helping out the owner of this place, and the new menu is identical to King & I (including dishes, prices, and even font!). So, you're looking to pay around $10 for an entree at dinner time. They do have a lunch menu with entree, fried rice, and spring roll for $6.50-7.50, depending on meat. Like King & I, the food is delicious. Good portions, lots of flavor. The inside of this place is teeny tiny, with just a few tables, but it's a great option for takeout or delivery (delivery fee is $2). Overall, if you like King & I, you'll like this place. It's good food for a pretty decent price, and it's the best option in this area.",4-star,positive

I use to eat this daily but now this option is removed with nothing comparable in quality and healthiness. I've come by a few times and nothing has interested me in their selection as it's mostly fried food and complex carbs. Today I decided to give it another try and purchased an Asian bowl for $7.99. It came with a scoop of white rice, about 2oz of chicken and small amounts of fresh veggies. A pretty small portion for the price. I gave this feedback in person to a few of the staff, but they just shrugged it off.

Several of the employees have complained about the prices that I spoke to also but they blame it on the expensive rent they have to pay and say that is why the food is so expensive. I will not be going there anymore and will not recommend anyone to go there either. The food is not worth the price, plenty of other places near by.",1-star,negative

In the begging I was confused between the tutti frutti tea & the persian tea and finally I opted for the last one !! the mixe of persian rose, orange blossom, lemon and honey is just perfect.

377,cafes_list,"Great rustic, cozy, kind of bohemian vibe. Perfect if you're looking for a small, familiar place to study or get some peace. Not loud, but not completely quiet because it's a small space, but the comfort of the space makes up for that very easily. The food is great, not to mention their different pleasant drinks they offer. Nothing like any other café you've seen. They offer water and syrup based beverages, a couple being saffron syrup, hibiscus syrup, and rose as well, which are all super refreshing and tasty. Most importantly the ambiance is super unique as it has a home-y feel to it, with cozy couches and comfortable seats. If I could describe the setting in a more understandable way I'd say it's sort of bohemian, with a natural and earthy feel (no earthy scent though don't worry lol), and also extremely student friendly with many books displayed on the shelves all around the café. There is also free wifi. Regular coffee options are of course offered as well, for the less daring of the traditional Persian drinks. Again, they offer very good sandwiches and pastries, as well as ethnically different desserts as to what would be expected in other cafés, which is greatly appreciated. Great for after a long day at school, at the Museum of Fine Arts as it's only a short walk away, or simply a big day of walking around in the city. Would definitely recommend, and I come every time I come downtown :)",5-star,positive

379,cafes_list,"Cafes like this are just one of the many reasons I miss Montreal so much. This places manages to hit a perfect checklist of things I want in a coffee shop, and I'll run through some of them. A: Good working environment. Despite being in a fairly small place, there is a lot of seating, it is fully economized (no wasted space here), and it still doesn't feel like everybody's elbow to elbow. There's also wifi. B: Solid tea and coffee options. The tea latte was a favorite of mine, and you get a shocking amount of beverage out of that little teapot. But some of their non-caffeinated options are just as good: water flavored with lemon and a variety of spices is surprisingly good at waking you up without leaving you jittery. C: The orienting theme is Persian, which comes across in the decor. It's not overly stylized, but it doesn't feel sterile like so many other cafes. D: The baked goods are seriously on point. I had a rosewater and saffron cake that was perfectly balanced in terms of flavor, with nothing too overwhelming or at risk of smothering the other flavors, and that is a difficult combination to pull off. E: Having sandwiches available for purchase. Much as I love baked goods and coffee, eventually the human body needs something more substantial to function. And the sandwiches aren't like the bland crap you find in so many other places, but are actually well-made, with appropriate levels of condiments. Even the bread is good. Maybe I'll move back here.",5-star,positive

Even their dishes are cute! I've come here to work or study and despite being a popular spot, it's pretty quiet & cozy! Their prices are slightly higher than the average independent cafe in Montreal but it's honestly marginal. They have tons of different types of tea so definitely check it out if you're a tea snob. I really like their tea latte. Good service, too! Cafe Aunja also hosts many events and they set up a hafseen in March for Persian new year.

Caffe Amante is located on the second floor (food court) level of Fifth Avenue Place, the home of HighMark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Amongst most of the mediocre chain food that's served on the same floor, it stands out as basically the only(or one of a few) sit down places available. Both times the service was right on point. Quick, efficient, despite being busy, friendly, wait-until-I-finish-my-sentence-sensitive, good recommendations on food. Corrected themselves when they were wrong in what they told me previously and so on. The two dishes I've had are: Special Salmon and jumbo lump crab meat. It was expertly cooked, great flavors, good portion size, and overall just a winning dish. Di Mare Amante which is a dish with shrimp, scallops, in a white clam sauce with capellini noodles. Their menu spells it with two p's: cappellini. Both were great and I'd have them again. You know, part of my review and rating is based on exactly what this place is: a more upscale place for the mostly business clientele bringing their customers out for a conveniently located lunch. In a restaurant that is more or less in a food court. Being surrounded chinese joints, mexican burrito places, and the philly cheese steak place. While I think it would be a solid bet for dinner as well --- that's not how I see this place positioned. I wouldn't take a date here Friday or Saturday night. There are more exciting places offering more adventures fare. This is not your $8 lunch.... most things are priced $12-$16 which includes bread. Their prices well justified by the quality of the food. For lunch, I'd go back to this place in a heartbeat.",5-star,positive

It's nothing special, it's just there. The good is good the service is okay as well. It's just kind of there. Nothing is every special or changing there. I hate calling it regular but that's truly what it is. If you're going for lunch look to spend about 10 bucks per meal and that's not including your beverage. It could be considered pricey depending on your lunchtime budget. I'm a fan of their chicken parmigiana. They also have a nice chopped salad. Plus free Breadworks rolls make everything better, right? I don't see it changing its ways anytime soon as the business travel through the place keeps it pretty steady. Why change what's no broken is probably what they're thinking, however, I really thinking the outdated decorations could really go.

Urine and other matters on the walls and stalls. Dirty toilets. The dirtiest floors I have ever seen in my life. Mildew on the tiles and all around the sink and a gross smell to blend in all in together. 4) The owners and staff should be embarrassed for the state of this location and for allowing patrons to have to endure all the nasty unhealthy and unsanitary conditions. 5) We will never go there again and I encourage you to think twice.

I love that they have cake and coffee combo (i ordered the decaf) cos it was late at night but i wanted to try it. i was contented with what i got. The cake was so desserts we so tasty with a pretty generous serving. My new favorite dessert place in Danforth! And oh, they close at midnight",5-star,positive
417,cafes_list,Really good quality food with big portions. Great choice for celebration or to get together. The shakes are a little expensive but good though.,5-star,positive
418,cafes_list,"I wish the service was better. This USE to be the only location I would go to but after my recent visit I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. I feel that café Demetre's food quality really went down hill. I didn't enjoy my dessert at all and I had a really bad tummy ache afterwards. Our server was very UNattentive, she didn't even greet my boyfriend and I she just asked us if we knew what we wanted, I find that very rude. Overall I will not be returning to this location.",1-star,negative
419,cafes_list,My boyfriend and I were hanging in the area saturday night and decided to go to caffe Demetre.

421,cafes_list,This review is strictly based on the service at this location. Very poor management. Huge line out the door with empty seats inside. People come in and order take out and sit at the tables and eat it. The hostess is no where to be seen. Waited in line for 30 minutes until I asked a server if we could sit and she gave us menus and took our order. Very disorganized.,1-star,negative
422,cafes_list,"Came here on a Thursday evening, it wasn't too busy and there was only one server working Pros - Ok price for based on quality, quantity and presentation (especially the waffle desserts) - Nice ambiance - Professional Cons - Don't get the Mango Sorbetto (tastes terrible)",4-star,positive
423,cafes_list,Now this is something. A great redefinition of dessert with weird funny names to their platters. Budget friendly and huge platters that can be good for two. A date there would be sweet and nice.,5-star,positive

425,cafes_list,"We were seated immediately upon entering. There were only 2 waitresses and very few empty tables. I never felt rushed or ignored. I don't usually eat dessert. However, I was trying to cleanse my palate on an awful dinner I had. I decided to have dessert here after seeing someone's plate. I couldn't decide between the Ella Fitzgerald or the Donatella Versace, the waitress gave me the best of both desserts. I substituted the bananas in the Donatella for the fresh strawberries in the Ella & the taste was absolutely DIVINE! I don't have a sweet tooth and this dessert proved perfect for me. It offers fresh strawberries with a warm Nutella drizzle & praliné croquant atop a fresh, warm Belgium waffle & whipped cream. If it weren't for the hair in my iced water, this would have been an excellent experience.",3-star,negative
426,cafes_list,"I had ""The Last Straw"" Belgian waffle which was pretty darn awesome . Warm waffle with vanilla ice cream strawberry compote, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream. Paired with a great cup of coffee it made for a very enjoyable desert experience. The only issue is their prices are on the high side for a desert only experience so you feel you didn't fully get value for your dollar.",4-star,positive
427,cafes_list,"The desserts are beyond amazing. Love the puns in the dessert names! I liked going when the store just opens because its a nice quiet space. Overall, very tasty desserts and I will probably go back",4-star,positive
428,cafes_list,"Went there during a busy time, i.e.Taste of Danforth. Despite being so busy, we received friendly service with prompt delivery of our desserts. Our table of 4 ordered one cake+ice cream, one waffle+ice cream, one ice cream and one ice cream cookie. The experience was great with my first timer friends overestimating their ability to consume a full serving of dessert. I enjoyed laughing at them and seeing them succumb to getting a take away box. In everyone's case, the ice cream was delicious and the added milk Belgian chocolate was amazing. The cookies were hard enough to cut but soft enough to chew without difficulty. Being able to give great service during a busy period is a true mark of a restaurant and worthy of leaving tips. I will return for more!",4-star,positive
429,cafes_list,Although I never had the chance to eat here I had a terrible experience in the establishment. I asked an European looking old guy if they do take outs and he just nodded yes. I asked him for the menu and he literally points at another waiter (rudely) and doesn't say anything. So I wait for the waiter to finish taking orders from another table and ask him for the menu and he rudely hands it over to me in frustration. It was awful. They dont care about serving customers because they know this place is so overrated. If it wasn't for instagram and other forms of social media people wouldn't know about it this place. If they fail to provide good service to your face who knows how much care they actually put into the quality of their food. They obviously don't give a shit because in Greektown everything stays in business. So long story short I left without ordering anything because I was completely ignored and the old guy was totally useless standing at the front. People are so stupid to waste their money here for over priced waffles and crepes/cakes.,1-star,negative
430,cafes_list,"I had mixed feelings about this place forever. On one hand it represents the excess that is North America i.e. monster sized desserts that can send one into a sugar induced coma and on the other hand they do make their crepes,waffles, toppings etc. fresh so that has to be appreciated. I hadn't been to this spot in eons as didn't want relive the sugar overload I associated with this place. The prices have gone up and now they do their ice creams in house. I settled for a waffle as if wants to indulge why settle on a crepe. Sure enough a monster sized serving that IMO should suffice for two people easy. Sugar nightmare realized as I felt awful after I woke up from this dream (sadly real). I can see the appeal of this spot as dessert only spots that are open late night are hard to come by I personally would rather have a smaller portioned richer dessert over a sweet one. 2 Stars.",2-star,negative
431,cafes_list,"Plus: Good location Big menu, a lot of choices Quick service Funny names in the menu Open late Minus: Some ice creams and waffles etc are just way too sweet and portions too big (share with a friend!)

Just too much! At least for my taste.",3-star,negative
432,cafes_list,This may be the worst location I have been to yet. I ordered apple pie and earl grey tea. The server kept telling me I couldn't have earl grey for the cake/coffee combo. I had to tell him several times I didn't want the combo and would pay separately for the tea and pie. The pie came with so much cinnamon on it I couldn't taste the apples. The server didn't bring any milk or a spoon for my tea and he didn't return to our table so I had to stir my tea with my fork. The service was slow and the server didn't return to the table to ask if we needed anything else or how the food was. I will never return to this location! So awful.,2-star,negative
433,cafes_list,"This place was awful- they had no cake available, the service was slow, they had no pop, and it was expensive. The desser- belgian waffle with apple crisp was decent overall.",2-star,negative
434,cafes_list,"Food: Got the chocolate paradox w/ crepe and caramel drizzle (3/5) Service: Horrible! Male hostesses/manager rude and unpleasant. The waitress got our order wrong, we didn't say anything because it was already made. (1/5) Ambience: Really Bad! Kitchen is right where you get served. barely able to hear each other over the sound of the clinging dishes. 3 of the workers including the manager stepped outside to smoke leaving the door wide open making the inside of the cafe smell of cigarettes. Yuk! 0/5 Price/ Value: $13 For a crepe + ice cream. A little pricy but not outrageous. 2/5 We have both been to other locations and this by far has been the worst. It is clear that this franchise is family run.",2-star,negative
435,cafes_list,"Caffe Demetre on Danforth used to be so good! Or I used to have poorer judgement... I've always enjoyed my visits there in the past- the waffles and crepes were great, along with the ice cream and toppings served on them. They used to feel overloaded. The last two visits there have been very disappointing. During the last visit, my friend and I shared a chocolate-y waffle. It tasted really dry and they really skimped out on the toppings. This time around, I really hoped that the last visit was just bad luck. I ordered an apple, peanut, and caramel crepe with honey vanilla ice cream. The crepe was far too chewy, and to my dismay, the apples were cold (and they are gooey so it tasted kind of gross). The peanuts were half peanuts that are usually found in supermarket tin cans. The waiter was really nice- nothing wrong with the service.",1-star,negative
436,cafes_list,Been about 10 years since my last visit to caffe Demetre. Like they say Once on the lips twice on the hips...or in my case on the belly. But it was a great place to top off an excellent evening. We both had crepes and enjoyed every bit of them.,4-star,positive
437,cafes_list,First time back here since they renovated and think there is a new set of owners. Really nice new decor but for some reason think they had a problem with heating because it was incredibly warm and humid in here today! Service was a bit slower than it used to be and the serving size of cake seems to have shrunk compared to before. I'll probably give them another chance since I still like their desserts.,3-star,negative

439,cafes_list,"After having dinner at a neighbouring greek restaurant I decided to hop on over to Demetres to satisfy my sweet tooth! The menu here is hugeee packed with an array of fresh made ice creams, crepes, waffles, cakes, shakes, and coffee drinks! I was craving ice cream and they had two flavours which immediately jumped out at me a peanut butter one and a coffee tiramisu ice cream. Our waitress was nice and gave us plenty of time and some suggestions because I couldn't decide on a flavour she said I should go for the peanut butter one but i could get two scoops for a $1 more so i decided on getting both! They serve two huge scoops in a fresh made waffle cone piled in a tall glass topped with whipped cream and a cherry on top! The coffee tiramisu ice cream was good but not my favourite..... i was expecting a stronger coffee flavour but it was much more milder with stronger cinnamon and honey flavours with graham crackers pieces in it. But the peanut butter ice cream was out of this world soooo good! Sweet cream ice cream blended with peanut butter with chopped peanuts just the perfect balance! and the waffle cone was nice and warm and sweet also! I will definately be returning for a double scoop of there fresh made peanut butter ice cream!",5-star,positive
440,cafes_list,"I'm not from Toronto so it shouldn't surprise you when I say ""What the fuck? Caffe Demetre is a chain?"" I don't believe it. I can't believe it. I am going to go ahead and deny I even know this information. The desserts here are too ridiculously delectable to be associated with a chain like status. But I guess that's the reason why there is more than one Caffe Demetre BECAUSE it is so fucking good. I had THEE best Carrot Cake of my life here. That's right as in never had better and probably never will have better. My life seems bleak knowing this but somehow I'll find a way to carry on my sad existence.",5-star,positive
441,cafes_list,"Why do you smell so good...but feed me such mediocre waffles. I feel like I should like you. We've been acquitted for so many years... You have ice cream. ..But it's hard to screw up ice cream. I keep eating at your establishment because people keep asking me to go. I'm just being polite. I'll just smile and eat my cake. We'll pretend you are actually a good dessert cafe, even though you are usually a last resort when there is no other dessert cafe around.",2-star,negative

444,cafes_list,"Been coming here for 6 months since moving back from Australia where the coffee culture is competitive - the coffee here is on par with the best baristas have to offer in Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney - well recommended for lattes and a healthy lunch :-) - service is always with a smile too @-@",5-star,positive
445,cafes_list,"I stopped by this place for breakfast earlier today. Good coffee, quick service, and close to my hotel (delta Montreal).

448,cafes_list,"The actual coffee is worth 4 stars but the employees push this place over the edge to give it that one extra star. The coffee here is definitely enjoyable. Take it from a self professed coffee snob, it's good. I've been popping in regularly for the past 7 years on my occasional trips to Montreal and it still is my favorite coffee spot in the area. As with any other place, it depends on how good your barista is. And John Bigsby is one of the best. But I'm sure he'll move on to bigger and better things soon. But this place will almost remain rock solid.",5-star,positive
449,cafes_list,"Searching for a perfect cup of Cappuccino is not that easy in Montreal.. Maybe I am just too picky but I found the few I have been too either too mild, too frothy, too sour, until I have the cappuccino at Caffe Art Java. One of the best cup I had. The vibe though might be a little commercial but the drinks and the latte art is definitely exceed my expectation! There is also a more quiet room at the back if you want more privacy without listening to the barista talking about their weekend plans.. Free wifi! I will be back!",4-star,positive
450,cafes_list,"While in Montreal in the fall I was making my way to the train but desperately needed a cup of coffee. I popped my head in here, being the first place I saw and it turned out they sell JJ Bean coffee. JJ Bean is a coffee roaster from Vancouver and I have a total love affair with it. Finding it in Montreal absolutely made my day. The cafe itself is quite cute, lots of places to sit and work. Looks like it mostly serves the uni crowd but all in all it was a great find!",4-star,positive
451,cafes_list,"My first thought after the first sip of their Latte: I'm not going to Starbucks anymore. My latte's ratio of steam/milk was just perfect, and the barista was hasty and efficient during the preparation and seemed very experienced. The latte was slightly expensive, but definitely not overpriced. Also had the Tomato and Garlic Soup, which was pretty mediocre, and it was slightly cold. The Milanais Sandwich, on the other hand, was quite tasty and full of flavours. The interior ambiance is great, and the decors were very nice, good for lunch or to enjoy a cup of coffee.",4-star,positive

J'y suis donc allée pour prendre un latte et travailler pendant quelques heures entre deux réunions. Le service a été très bien, les prix sont justes et ça tout pris pour que je résiste de prendre un des muffins à la citrouille et aux épices qui étaient encore dans le moule. Je me suis installée à l'arrière sur une chaise confortable avec un plateau de style ""tv-dinner"" pour y mettre mon laptop et mon café. J'ai bien aimé l'ambiance et le latte mais je n'ai pas été époustouflée par quoi que ce soit. Tout était bon et correct, rien de plus, rien de moins. Définitivement un bon endroit pour une petite pause dans le centre-ville.",3-star,negative
456,cafes_list,"The latte was so good that I had to dish out my first 5 star for a coffee shop. The latte they serve was truly exceptional....even when I order it iced. (I draw my line for iced latte at about 20 below freezing) I have no idea where they got a croissant from, but that was incredible as well. It's hard to imagine this being a chain store. I'm a huge fan of croissants, and their croissants are well layered with buttery flakes. This can't be good for my health, but it's utterly delicious for my taste buds. This is going to break my starbucks addiction while I'm in montreal.",5-star,positive
457,cafes_list,"I was in a hurry and about to board a train but I saw that this place was close and a change from the larger chain coffee shops so I checked it out on the weekend.

It offers lots of space, free Wifi and there are televisions (on mute!) which is something that you don't often see in cafes.",4-star,positive
458,cafes_list,"On my trip to Montreal I discovered a few things: The Yelpers there aren't as generous with their FUCing, and there is apparently such thing as 'Yelp Rating Integrity.' Supposedly, if I give too many things high ratings, you'll all think I'm an easily pleased push over that just wants everyone to be nice to each other... Yeah, well, this place was awesome, just like everywhere else I went -- Yelp Integrity be damned! Caffé Art Java is faaaaabulous.The chocolatines were great and my chai latte was fab (no art because it's difficult to create pretty things without dreamy brown coffee to draw the pictures, sadly), but thing I was most impressed with was the steamed milk. I am a foam nazi. if the foam is weak and watery, everything tastes 10 points sadder. Even if it's made with the steamed tears of baby unicorn-centaur cross-breeds. This steamed milk was so thick! I kept marveling at it's ability to stay on my spoon when I turned it upside down. ""Look, baby! It's not moving! Right way up, upside down, right way up, upside down... IT'S JUST STAYING ON THE SPOON!!"" Yep, and I was no longer jealous of his cappuccino art. My steamed milk is strong and independent, like a white Beyonce! Who needs art when you got all of *THIS*? Yup, that's what I thought. Five starts, Caffe Art Java, five stars.",5-star,positive
459,cafes_list,"For coffee nuts or west-coast transplants, this place is a must. They use Vancouver's own JJ Bean product, they use actual barista-grade soy milk (not the cereal-tasting stuff) and the staff clearly know how to make specialty coffee drinks. (The croissants are also baked on site each morning, which is basically worth another star by itself.) The luxury seating area is also a nice plus for people who want to just sit and read or talk, and you've got free 2.4/5GHz WiFi N. What's not to like?",5-star,positive

My americano was one of the better ones I tasted in Montreal and my lemon poppy seed muffin was moist.

What really gives Art Java bonus points is the ample seating and wi-fi. For that, I say merci beaucoup!",4-star,positive
461,cafes_list,"It looked artsy and independent from the outside, but once inside I realized they were trying way too hard. The person who took my order didn't do more than just grunt to me and didn't tell me that I could pick up my drink along a separate wall. It was a bustling Saturday afternoon and the place was empty. You would have thought he'd been more happy to see me. When the barista handed me my drink I realized they'd gotten my order wrong. Somehow, my order for iced coffee became a chai latte. I can't really blame the French/English barrier here as they were both speaking to each other in English. When I pointed out that my order was incorrect. He sighed and said that he wouldn't be able to redo it until his manager came back because it was a different price and he didn't have the authority to change it in the till. What? Not knowing when he'd be back, I decided just to leave and make my way back to the hotel...in 90 degree F weather...with a piping hot chai latte. What saves this from the 1 star category is that I'll admit that it was a darn good chai latte! Spicy and frothy at the same time. I would have liked it much better on a chilly day, but I'll take it.",2-star,negative

Yelp didn't seem to do Montreal then, so I checked coffee geek or something like that to find out where to get espresso while I was there. My meetings were right across the street from where I was staying, and this place was about a mile away. Every morning I walked round-trip in the snow to get a cappuccino -- they're that good. Really really good. Great shots, perfect milk, straight pour with free-poured art. The art itself isn't a big deal to me, but to do art like that, you need good foam; so good art is a sign of good foam. One day I got a sandwich, intending to keep it for later, but it came pressed, so I ate it. It was fantastic -- called grand-pere, and I can't remember exactly what it had in it, but I've had a couple more since then, and it comes with choice of salad (the garbanzos are really good). The bagels are good too. There's a little room in the back with comfy chairs, tray tables, and TV's; the music is OK. I've been back to Montreal several times since then, and go to this Art Java location almost every day. And they definitely DO have free internet.",5-star,positive

We looked at a few of the patios before settling on this one. We decided to get coffee, a pizza and some desert. I have a macchiato for my coffee. It was pretty good. For our pizza we asked them to make us half and half of the prosciutto and arugula/spinach and goat cheese. It was good, nice and thin with their crusts and then fire roasted. I was happy with that. It was decent. There might have been too much arugula on the one side but that might just be me. I like it but I'm not the biggest fan. For desert we tried the Chocolate Mousse Cake and the Tiramisu. They were both good but the Cake was better. The Tiramisu was way too running in my opinion. The service and patio was good however, and you honestly cannot beat the location.

On the table was some really good hot chilli oil. The server mentioned to me the family matriarch makes a huge batch one a year. It was all very tasty. To wash it down I started with a iced cappuccino which was creamy and very easy drinking. This area of little Italy is a great place to side and watch the world walk by. Great on a lazy weekend day.

476,cafes_list,"Classique restaurant italien du quartier italien, on ne sort vraiment pas des sentiers battus au Café Epoca. Pates, pizza, carne, tout les grands classiques y sont.

Not a family dining experience, but they were definitely hospitable to us :-) Penne Arrabiata= not spicy, but the pasta was cooked perfectly. Pasta Primavera= not a fan anyway, didn't care for the use of yellow peppers, but again, pasta cooked perfectly. Arugula/Parmesean salad= delish. Perhaps if we go back, after reading other reviews, I'll have to try the pizza!",3-star,negative
479,cafes_list,"Pizza was bangin'! Gnocci in rose sauce...delicious. The best mochaccino I've had since being in Italy. Quick and attentive service. The fried calamari was a very tasty and large starter. It was, however, more expensive than our main courses. Good place to stop for lunch if you are shoping at Jean Talon market.",4-star,positive
480,cafes_list,"Where have you been all my life? I finally decided to try cafe Epoca for lunch today. My friend and I each ordered a pizza. They were flippin' incredible. Perfection! I'm rating this restaurant on my pizza alone. I have no idea what the rest of the food taste like, and quite frankly I couldn't give a damn! I'm going to go back to this restaurant and order pizza again and again. Sure the service was friendly, sure I was sitting at the open terrace on march 19th enjoying the warm weather. But wow... What a delicious pizza I had for lunch. It just might be the best pizza I ever ate.",5-star,positive
481,cafes_list,"I agree with the other reviewers about this place it is chill and the pizza is always good, I tend to visit this place in the summer, and sit outside.

482,cafes_list,"Epoca is something of an institution in Montreal. Sort of like the Peach Pit in 90210, it's the safe bet that's also family friendly. Situated right on St. Laurent smack in the middle of the action of Little Italy, it's got a few outside tables and large sliding windows that open the place up to the street. Three or four TVs are always on, usually playing a Juve game or the afternoon Formula races. The patrons are a cool mix of Italian young families out for an early lunch, the odd couple sharing a pizza, a few friends sipping espresso and philosophizing, and two or three goons in track suits and Scuderia Ferrari hats glued to the TV while playing with their Honda or Chevy car keys. The menu is pretty impressive for what looks like a dedicated coffee-shop. Everything from pizza to pasta dishes to even fish is served, all of it quite good. You really can't go wrong with anything here - it won't blow you away, but you're there for good coffee, good solid comfort food, and a relaxed, unpretentious atmosphere. Epoca delivers those things in spades, and earns a solid 4 stars.",4-star,positive
483,cafes_list,"When we moved to Little Italy we asked our Italian friends if there were any places they or their families would particularly recommend. One told us that her (very) Italian padre always went to Epoca for the prosciutto pizza. This has become a regular spot for us since, we tuck into the back booth and load up on antipasto and carbs. It's not a fancy spot, there is a tv that's usually on and the staff is never in a rush. There is hot oil, hot peppers, and parm on every table and a nice small outdoor terasse on St Laurent with room for a few tables. The pizza dough is thin and soft and fresh, the ingredients are generally local and delicious (we are right next to the Jean Talon market, if you are not getting your produce right in this neighborhood you are doing something really wrong). Epoca isn't trying to be old timey, or fancy, it's just a chill, tasty way to hit the spot.",4-star,positive
484,cafes_list,"This was a really nice little cafe that we stumbled upon as we were wandering around Petite Italie. The servers were really friendly and attentive (and accommodating... we don't speak French, and they were very patient with us), and the food was fantastic! Try the chicken cutlet panini, or the gnocchi, both were delicious, and you could tell that the food had been prepared with fresh ingredients. Their sangria is also pretty tasty, check that out as well. The only downside was that it took a while for us to get our food, and there were only a few other parties being served at the time. I mean it was definitely worth the wait, but if you're in any sort of a hurry, this isn't the place to stop for a quick bite to eat. Overall: Great food, great staff, great restaurant. I would highly recommend it to anyone that's in the area and looking for some good Italian food.",4-star,positive

I will say that it is kinda pricey, but at least the food is good, so that helps to take the sting out of the lunch bill.

First of all, the place is lovely : it's well decorated, the atmosphere is relaxing, and the waiters are really nice and quick. I was surprised by the lunch deals they have : not only the prices are quite cheap, but the food is delicious! I had little ""merveilles"" (small sandwiches comparable to tapas) and a salad, both excellent. I didn't try the cakes but we did take chouquettes, and they were among the best I've ever had (and also a lot cheaper than those you can find at Première Moisson, for example).",5-star,positive

The espresso they serve is comparable if not better than the best available in Montréal. The treats I have tried so far were excellent, and not overly sweet. Update: Unfortunately the quality of the coffee seems variable depending on the barista. When the owner is there he usually pulls a good cup.",5-star,positive

The employee tried to serve me cheese (I corrected her as soon as I saw her heating it up) and argued with me, saying that's what I ordered (I never order cheese) instead of pepperoni. She did change it but it wasn't very good. After eating it I wished I hadn't. Costco pizza is far better. Skip the pizza here unless it's for a little kid who isn't picky. Go to Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan if you want amazing pizza. It's worth the walk. Next time I'd use my credit for bottled juice or water. You can't really mess that up.",2-star,negative

499,cafes_list,"It's always a shame when a restaurant places convenience (for their staff) over good service and a comfortable dining experience for customers. Especially when their execution is awful. I had previously been to another Cafe Zupas. Not bad, but not great either. I went to this location today with my family. It was a bad decision. Atmosphere is nice when you walk in. When you attempt to order is where it goes sideways. Ordering is chaotic and disorganized. The guy in front of me orders a salad with ranch dressing. The girl making salads informs him that her bottle of ranch is empty and to choose another dressing. He politely asks if they are out of ranch in the whole restaurant or just that bottle. She tells him the whole restaurant is out of ranch. He chooses something else. I order a sandwich and soup and a kids meal (chicken tenders and fruit). She sends me down the line to the soup area where I'm told I will choose a soup. I wait at least 5 minutes while they work on other people's orders. Whose orders they were, I have no idea. I order soup and get herded to the cashier area. Another girl asks me ""what did you order?"" I tell her and she rings me up and I pay. After I pay, she asks ""did you want a drink?"" I say yes and pay again. I still have no food. Yet another girl comes and asks me ""what did you have?"" There are probably 7-8 sandwiches, 6 salads and several bowls of soup sitting in front of her. It's clear that she has no clue what belongs to whom. I repeat my order again. It's another 5 minutes before I get my tray of food. The food looks like it's getting cold. I ask her if I can have ranch for the chicken tenders. She says yes and returns several minutes later with the ranch. I guess they weren't out of ranch as the other girl suggested. My tomato basil soup was gritty and had weird lumps. My sandwich was not hot and had water dripping from it. The food was nasty. The cups they use for kids meals are the cheapest I've ever seen. I attempted to put a lid on my daughter's drink and the plastic cup crumbled under my hand. Drink spilled everywhere. Cafe Zupas is a joke. The meat in the sandwich was poor quality and the portions are tiny. Will not be back.",1-star,negative
500,cafes_list,"Went here today and ordered a full salad and my daughter ordered a half salad. The half salad was in a smaller bowl and somewhat full and the whole salad was less than half full. So I paid full price for a half salad. Annoying! Plus they have become so skimpy on the ingredients. Only found a couple pieces of chicken and very slim amounts of other ingredients in both salads. The chocolate covered strawberries lacked chocolate and were super tart. Really? You have to cut back on everything?? This place was busy but I'm guessing that will change as soon as regulars see how they have cut back. This location used to be a favorite however, now Panera Bread or Wildflower Bread Company that are both right across the street from this location is a better choice for us in the future.",2-star,negative

I didn't feel like I was eating unhealthy when I had the mangoberry salad and tomato soup. The portion size was great and I love that it came with a piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. What a sweet touch. If I could easily visit a Cafe Zupas, I would definitely return to try the paninis and I would create my own salad. I love having that option. Additionally, the staff seemed nice and the dining room and bathrooms were clean. Care to expand to the DC area??",5-star,positive

Not a big fan of having to pays extra for some chip crumbs but whatever it's worth it. Soup is 5 stars. They know we as consumers will pay extra so I can't blame them. Also I was not a big fan of their choices for sandwiches. I figured most sandwich places have something close to a roast beef sandwich, but not here. That is the only reason I take off one star. I would have bought the soup and sandwich if they had that option. Overall this place is great. Many options for most people...just not if you like roast beef.",4-star,positive

They asked if we would like to try samples of any of their array of items. I tried the crab salad which was fresh & light with just the right amount of flavor. I tried their lobster bisque as well & found it loaded with chunks of succulent lobster & alive with flavor that finished with just the right amount of heat!! For what I had always assumed was just a simple ""soup & salad shop"", I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh, vibrant array of ingredients; they had everything from quinoa to pistachios & from leafy kale to bright red tomatoes. Your salad options are limited only by your own imagination & your taste buds!! The paninis were crunchy & delicious & did I mention that a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry completes your meal?!? It was delicious!!

I've tried the strawberry, red velvet, salted caramel, wedding cake white and the list goes on and on. If I go to lunch on West 25th, I always stop her on my way back to work. I pick up cupcakes for home and usually bring back a few for my co-workers. The price is right, more bang for your buck than other establishments at $2.50 for an oversized cupcake. I also enjoy the Dichotomy popcorn which is caramel corn and cheese corn mix. It's not Garrett's in Chicago, but pretty darn close. There are multiple varieties of popcorn (free samples), chocolates and other goodies. This place is definitely worth a field trip. They also participate in PayCloud.

The popcorn here is absolutely perfect! This beats movie theater popcorn by a 1000%. There's also a big variety or chocolate covered everything: pretzels, cookies, strawberries and jalapeños. They also have some pretty big cupcakes, caramel and candy apples. We did not indulge further because we did not want to spoil our lunch but will be going back to try all of their extra goodies:) If you're in the area pay them a visit, you won't be disappointed if you do:) Update: I visited Campbell's again today (1/20/14) and purchased half a dozen cupcakes. These were by far the worst cupcakes I've ever had. We were not able to eat them because they were too sweet. My kids took sips of milk in between bites but they were not able to finish them. If three young teenagers aren't able to eat them, then you know there's a problem. I'm still giving them five stars because their popcorn is worthy of this rating. To the management: please stick to the popcorn and leave the cupcakes alone.",5-star,positive
542,cafes_list,"So so good. They have about 5 samples a day of popcorn you can try out of the over 20 flavors they sell. I haven't bought the same kind yet, always buying something I've sampled. Their buckeye caramel covered apples are to die for. I've tried 5 of their cupcakes, still not thrilled with them. They have a case of chocolates too that is very good. The staff is very friendly. They have a very, VERY, narrow ramp into the building for wheelchairs, if not caught just right, its possible to miss it with a wide wheel chair. Usually a staff member runs to the door and has to help me push the chair into the building. They do have two stands in the west side market. One with the popcorn and chocolates and the other with their cupcakes in 2 different locations.",5-star,positive
543,cafes_list,"With my friend at the West Side Market and we decided to get a snack. This place was great - the dozens of popcorn flavors were great! They have testing bins up front and all kinds of chocolates and other things. Got a cookie and also bought some mint chocolate popcorn. At the Market, they had all their stuff and even more samples. It was great!",5-star,positive
544,cafes_list,"I wandered in here by chance one day while visiting Cleveland. By ""wandered in"" I mean, I saw the sign and ordered my friend to park the car immediately. I had a terrible sweet tooth, the kind where you can't be held responsible for your actions. Anyway, I walked (power walked/awkward-walk-where-you-are-holding-back-running'ed) in and gazed upon a most plentiful clinic for my sweet tooth! Chocolate covered popcorn, along with everything else you could possibly dip in chocolate! Yummy! I quickly gathered together my chocolate covered cure and feasted in the car on my way back to Cincinnati! I hope they open up a shop near me soon!",4-star,positive
545,cafes_list,"We all know that popcorn is good for you. Now thanks to Campbell's, it is as ""Mmmm-Mmmm Good!"" as other things with the name Campbell's :) I was lucky enough to have my first taste of Campbell's last night at a Yelp event, and man was it awesome! I downed an entire bag of cheddar bacon last night and just polished off White Cheddar Jalapeno Popcorn today. Like I said, Mmm-mmm good! There are also sweet flavors of popcorn for people who want a little something to balance out the savory. I'm a fan of cheesy/savory anything, and if it's added to something healthy, that just means it's delicious and healthy! Definitely a must-visit destination no matter your craving!",5-star,positive
546,cafes_list,The most wondrous cupcakes ever await you here. With flavors too amazing to wrap your mind around. They have the best Red Velvet.....ever!,5-star,positive
547,cafes_list,"The dichotomy popcorn - cheese and caramel - is entirely overrated. However, the cheddar cheese jalapeno popcorn is to die for. The cupcake truffles - especially the wedding cake, the M&Ms, and the buckeyes - are great, and not too bad on your wallet at less than a dollar each. I look forward to trying the millions of other flavors listed on their website. For those who don't know, Grandma Campbell's cupcakes are the same as Grandma Frieda's in the West Side Market. Apparently the owners are doing some rebranding for consistency.",4-star,positive
548,cafes_list,"I stopped by their stand in the West Side Market for a cupcake, and later came here to get popcorn and buckeyes. The cupcake was amazing--key lime. I'm not usually a fan of dense cupcakes, but this one was moist and tasted great. The frosting was sweet but a little tangy. The popcorn (I tried fruity and got dichotomy) was soooo good. The buckeyes were just so so in my book. (My sister makes better ones!) Overall, definitely worth a stop. :)",4-star,positive
549,cafes_list,"I was here the other day. I found their prices to be very good. I got a 1 gallon bag of popcorn for 6 bucks. It was the carmel dipped in cheese kind. I like the idea of the popcorn but after awhile I was just hoping for just a piee of carmel or just a piece of cheese. I give the popcorn 4 stars. I got a red velvet cupcake. I make my own cakes and I find my red velvet to be the best. This was pretty good, not amazing but good. The price I found to be lower than what I expected. It was $2.50 for a huge cupcake. I give the cupcake 3.5 stars Then I got a cake pop. I recently started making my own cake pops and they have turned out incredible so I wanted to try others. You get one pop for $1.50. I tried the wedding cake flavor. It was mediocre at best. It kinda felt like there was too much frosting added to the cake making it appear to be raw. And then I found a hair in my cake pop. So the cake pops gets a very low score for me. Overall, it was cheap, I would get popcorn again and maybe a cupcake if I was really craving it.",3-star,negative
550,cafes_list,"I am a huge fan, and a converted popcorn lover. Before encountering Campbell's at a Yelp event, I thought I didn't like popcorn. As I came to learn on Campbell's factory tour (which was awesome!), the reason I like Campbell's and not other popcorns is because of the type of corn kernel they use. Apparently the kind they use has less of the kernel shell that gets stuck in your teeth, which was the whole reason I always hated popcorn. Obviously, the tour was very informative. It was also fun. We made chocolate dipped caramel corn balls, and the tour price included a voucher to spend in the gift shop! I am so addicted to their treats now that I keep trying to come up with reasons to buy bags of popcorn as gifts for people so I have an excuse to visit the store.",5-star,positive
551,cafes_list,"Aaand... I'm dead. I must be. I've died and gone to fat kid heaven. Popcorn, pretzels and cupcakes oh my. And free samples of every flavor of popcorn. They have mastered the art of salty sweet with there delectable puffed kernels of goodness. The best by far is dichotomy, it has the richness of Carmel and the savorieness of cheese. It sounds weird but most amazing things do.",5-star,positive
552,cafes_list,"Caramel Apple, Nacho Cheese, Dichotomy, Cocoa, Banana Split all delicious treats in and of themselves but when they come in popcorn form it just makes it extra delicious! Consistency of flavor is what makes all these treats so good. They are true to their inspiration and make you wanna slap your mamma. Love, love, love them! Plus you can sample to your little hearts content. Honestly what more can you want from a store? They also offer local coffee beans, cupcakes and chocolate treats that I did not try. My obsession with Campbells is based on the popcorn alone.",5-star,positive
553,cafes_list,"Is it weird to say that this is the best smelling store and I wish I could bottle their scent and make it into a lotion? Probably, but I don't care. This place is where dreams are made. Walking in is total adhd overload. Look at the popcorn! And the candy! Oooh cupcakes (everyone knows I have a soft spot for cupcakes, given my tattoo and employment)! Everyone is cheerful, I mean... how could you not be, working in a popcorn shop as beautiful as this?! While I've always loved their stand in the market, Campbell's is a welcome storefront on up-and-coming w.25th . I was shocked at their extremely reasonable prices. My friend filled up a large box for ten bucks. The popcorn, as always, is wonderful. You've got to try the Dichotomy, cheesy, caramelly, wonderfulness. I could totally fill up on all the samples and they'd have to wheel me outta there. Dill pickle, strawberry shortcake, fruity pebbles... all of the flavors were spot on. Its really a good thing I got a gym membership a few months ago because damn, those chocolates look good. They even have chocolate covered jalapeños (which I am dying to try...)! I previously stated something about making everyone's gifts this year but I think I might just cheat and buy a lot of Campbell's. J",4-star,positive
554,cafes_list,"We've already established that in my eyes, popcorn is a sign from god that he loves us and wants us to be happy. If that's true, then Campbell's Sweets Factory's plethora of popcorn flavors (*ahem* white cheddar....) is like god giving me a high five, plus a fist bump. Seriously, how could you not love a shop full of free popcorn samples? I mean, there are at least 20 different flavors lined up on the counter to taste. Oh, and did I mention fresh, decadent cupcakes and chocolate covered goodies? Oreos, gummy worms, you name it--it's covered in chocolate. Talk about a kid in a candy store... And everything is made in house. Don't believe me? You can actually watch them make everything in front of you. Heck, you can watch them churn out batches of homemade caramel corn and popcorn balls from the sidewalk. (And you can smell it, too) *Queue drooling now* Beyond the delicious treats and great gift ideas (hint, hint: Yelp Shops Local Pledge), what really makes me feel warm and fuzzy about Campbell's is that it's a family run business. No, really. It's a whole family operation--and a great one at that. The Campbells have to the the nicest folks I have ever met. They have reasonable prices, hours and there's no reason for you to not stop by when you're in the Ohio City/ SoLo neighborhood. Oh, and street parking is available, just not during the hours of 4-6pm (I think.) And as mentioned before, don't park across the street in the ghetto shopping plaza. They're mean and will tow you. BOOOOO!",5-star,positive
555,cafes_list,"I think I would set up camp in their store if I could. If you like their stand at the West Side Market, do yourself a favor and go a few blocks down W 25th to their store. It smells absolutely amazing between the popcorn, baked goods, and chocolates. I took my mom, aunt, and cousin, and between the four of us, we walked out with just about one of everything. I paired a bag of their dill pickle popcorn, my personal favorite, with a chocolate-covered Oreo in a cute ladybug design. Salty and sweet goodness. Mom got a chocolate turtle and was not disappointed. We also sampled the cupcake truffles, bite-size nuggets of happiness. I took pity on my husband and brought him a buckeye cupcake, which I was more than happy to help him with later. Good thing they don't have wifi and tables. I may never leave.",5-star,positive
556,cafes_list,"I love the different varieties of chocolate covered pretzels they have. The chocolate to pretzel ratio is what it like lol (if that makes sense). It's not too much chocolate coated on the pretzel. They have this Turtle Pretzel that is sooo freakin' yummy. They only thing I craved today was pretzels lol and I ran there to pick up a few...it was hard to leave the place because everything look so dee-lish. The popcorn they have can be a little daring. I tried I think some kind of Jalapeno popcorn and even though I love hot and spicy stuff...that left me in tears lol really! But the carmel corn, when it's warm, is really good!",5-star,positive
557,cafes_list,"My favourite chatime place in all other places. They finish your drink within a reasonable amount of time, and deserts always taste fresh. Their raspberry macaroons are exceptionally good, could say that it's my favourite! Sadly this is the only chatime place where I have seen raspberry macaroons. I come here all the time to chill with my friends, and the staff are always welcoming and kind.",5-star,positive
558,cafes_list,"I was craving a fix for some bbt and a pick me up to get the day started. Stumbled upon this chatime which was in the same plaza as the grocery store. The store was empty so the service was quick. I ordered a regular roasted milk tea with tapioca 30% sugar and ice. Although the service was fast, I noticed that the way he made the bbt was extremely sloppy. The liquid jus overflowed everywhere and had not care. Yes he wiped down the drink but the drink was so poorly made with zero care. I normally don't come to this location and only visit the Dundas and bay location but this experience does not make me want to come back",1-star,negative
559,cafes_list,"Came here with a few friends after work. Luckily, we were able to get a table. It's still a fairly new Chatime location in a busy week at the corner of Leslie and Finch. You'll need to do some digging as it's located near the back of the plaza. It wasn't busy coming here. Like many of their chatime's, this one isn't too big either with very limited seating area. This one surprisingly sells a lot of macaroons here. You can't go wrong with Chatime so it's a great choice to get bubble tea here with their extensive drink menu. Perhaps, this one isn't as busy here compared to the other ones located in very busy high traffic areas. Don't forget to always tap your Vicinity card to collect those points for free drinks and other perks!",4-star,positive
560,cafes_list,"I found a piece of broken plastic in my drink. I bought their Palm-egranate Passion summer drink with tapioca. When I finished the drink, I noticed that there was still a tapioca piece left in the cup. Upon closer inspection, it was actually a broken piece of black plastic. I'm guessing it could have been a piece of the blender that broke off when they were making the drink. At first, I didn't notice it since it was black and it easily looked like a broken/flattened piece of tapioca and it was easy to miss. I suppose I could have performed a close inspection of my drink when I got it, but I don't think most people do that as they normally don't expect pieces of plastic to be in it. Luckily for me, this piece of plastic couldn't fit through my straw so I wouldn't have been able to swallow it. It obviously wasn't intentional, but employees should be more careful next time when preparing drinks. I'm pretty disappointed as I always have a positive experience at Chatime and enjoy their. It's too bad that something like this happened!",1-star,negative

562,cafes_list,If you are a bubble tea enthusiast you will love Chatime. Their menu is extensive and has as much variety as you would want in a bubble tea place. They have a TV screen showing their top 10 bubble teas. It really helps cut down on the options because there are so many things to choose from. I had the grass jelly roasted milk tea and it was really tasty. The staff is quick and helpful. The store is clean and nicely lit. Lots of students come here to study. They also have those little Asian cookies. I'd recommend Chatime for sure!,4-star,positive

564,cafes_list,"Phoned in with a large order and they handled it without any issue, except they made a minor mistake with taking the order for one of the drinks. Other than that, service was pleasant and nothing special. Quality of the drinks is as you'd expect from Chatime more widely (in other words, quite decent and definitely above-average as far as bubble tea places go). Like most Chatime locations, it is relatively small with very limited seating avaiable. Plaza is also a disaster at night and especially on weekends; parking situation is absolutely horrendous.",3-star,negative
565,cafes_list,"The ""red"" pocket giveaway is probably the worst offer I've seen in a while. You get a coupon (buy one get one $.88 regular sized drink) and another coupon for $5 off for the Tian Bao travel store (what???). The drinks here also didn't taste as good as other cha time locations in Markham or even Mississauga. The pearls were overcooked and there was just too much milk in my drink. It also seems to be a place where kids like to study these days? So it'll be hard finding a table here in the evenings.",3-star,negative
566,cafes_list,"This location feels a bit small and dimly lit. Service wasn't exactly the friendliest. It felt very robotic. They have pretty small tables, but you can take up multiple wall tables if you have a huge group. Not sure if I would go back. It's awkwardly placed behind the plaza away from other establishments. There is a supermarket and a restaurant next door, but I would feel a lot more comfortable if I could access it more easily. I got the #1, but it tasted a bit watered down here despite me not getting any ice.",3-star,negative
567,cafes_list,"They need to make their ordering process easier. Speaking slowly with a Canadian English accent doesn't make for a speedy order. Why not use an app and have patrons order (hmm may be even order online to reduce the congestion), prepay, and just pick up. This way, this eliminates the communication challenges; thus, allowing their staff to concentrate on the food preparation and not for all parties straining for what is said.",3-star,negative

I seriously saw a lambo stalled on the side as the guy waited for his gf to rush back with the drinks.. this was all happening as a mom-van was trying so hard to back out and held up approx 6 cars behind her for about 7 min.. me, being one the cars stuck behind this mess was already frustrated. I had to park upstairs, where it literally reminds me of my old days of playing grand theft auto. So empty but also a bit sketch. I've been here before and the waits are bad, but not horrible. The store this time was a complete mess. I walked in and saw people lined up in different areas while the worker was screeching at everyone to line up against the side of the wall. Not the store's fault, but it was complete havoc. Crazy asians.. how do you not know how to follow a line? After being ambushed by two crazies, I finally got into the line. I lined up for approximately 3 minutes before glancing at the waiting area and saw how long it took to even collect your drink. So many people and such a little store is a problem, especially with not a lot of chatimes in this area. I was done at that point and decided to just leave. Boo.. I really wanted chatime that day.",1-star,negative

The service was super fast, two people ahead of me, waited 3 minutes and as I was deciding if I wanted less ice and sugar, they already started my drink, as soon as I said less sugar,less ice, all the ingredients are thrown into the mixer, and made.

Found a parking spot immediately when entering the parking lot which was a bit of a bonus considering the amount of restaurants in the plaza it is located. Ordered a roasted milk tea with tapioca, less ice and sugar. At first when I received my drink, the sugar syrup and milk was poorly mixed (the tea was still mostly at the bottom). The tapioca was hard and took a while to chew - it definitely was not cooked long enough. I could taste the milk powder as I was drinking it. This Chatime location isn't as good as the one I usually go to at Warden and Steeles. I only came here because I was craving bubble tea and this location was nearby. Probably not coming back here.",2-star,negative
579,cafes_list,"I pop by here pretty often since I live walking distance away, but the service has always been hit or miss. Some days my order comes out perfect, other days they mess it up and have to redo it. Some days when they're extremely busy they don't want to deal with my complicated mass order, so they just say they don't do this or don't have that. I understand, it's a small place and for some reason they get a huge influx of customers that overwhelms them every now and then so ... I'll let it slide. BUT. Opening a chatime in this plaza (while it's awesome for me), is pretty terrible overall. The plaza is swarmed with a lot of food options so it's always crowded, parking is atrocious there and the chatime here is quite small in comparison to others - on par with the Mississauga location I think, or possibly smaller.

We had reservation for a group of three on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was very easy to reach, and we were seated immediately. The menu is not very long, but every item on it is solid. Or should I say, every item we tried were solid. For appetizer, we got the Chawk platter, which was really good. For main we had the Duck bhuna, Sea Brim, and Lamb Risotto. Each of the mains stood out on their own. The portion size is adequate, and the presentation is also tasteful. Finally, for dessert we got the paan kulfi, and I have to tell you, it is a must try. We really enjoyed the whole experience and would definitely return. I have heard good things about their Ramadan Iftaar specials. Cannot wait to try it out. P.S This is my pet peeve, and probably irrelevant, but I check the cutlery and dishes used in restaurants that I dine in.

591,cafes_list,"Two reviews with five stars each. Here's a third. Honestly, Chawk deserves it. I go out to eat quite a bit, and I try to eat at as many new places as possible because I get bored easily. This year, with my birthday around the corner, I've been in a bit of a food slump because I feel like I've had many of things Toronto has to offer already. Chawk ended that slump. I can't stop gushing. First, the inside is beautiful. Very chic, very modern, and very Instagrammable. Second, the service is super friendly and super helpful. Even before we ordered, complimentary lychee mango drinks were given to us. What an indication of the meal to come! The food. THE FOOD. I can't say enough good things about the food. If I don't hit the character limit for this review, I'll be super surprised. Chawk has two appetizer platters. Both of them are stunning and come on a wooden board. Both of them consist of entirely different options. Each come with 4 appetizers, and cost $15. The chawk platter came with phuchka (pani puri with mashed chickpea inside), mini singara (almost like a samosa), bihari sliders (beef kebab on fresh flatbread), and macher tikki (fishcake). Oh. And chop suey fries? Think really thin, delicious, fried potato string garnish. Phuchka - You fill the phuchka with tamarind water and you down it fast. Otherwise, it leaks out. It's meant to be that way. Savory, refreshing, slightly sweet, slightly tangy. Mini Singara - Almost like a rounded samosa. The potato and chickpea filling was very fluffy. I appreciated being able to see the layers of filling in my singara. The tamarind sauce was tasty as well. Macher tikki - I was skeptical. Fish cakes aren't my thing. Usually over-breaded and over-spiced. Not the case here. Thin breading. Could still taste the fish under it. Crispy. Flaky. Served with a spiced mayo. Bihari slider - three/four bite taco sized. AMAZING. You could taste the beef through the spices. The carrot/beet/onion strings on top helped cut some of the richness, and the flatbread was so fluffy! I could make a meal out of these babies and be super satisfied. Then comes our main. Just one between the two of us because the appetizer platter was so large. All day breakfast. Interesting. Lamb shank, frittata, steamed spicy potatoes, tart eggplants, stuffed parathas, fruit chaat, and an egg done our way. Also $15, and also served on a board. Well, a board and a plate, cuz the lamb shank wouldn't fit onto the board. Our sunny side up was done right. Oozy yolk. Plus points for crispy brown edges. I've got to hand it to them. Every curried food item we had tasted distinct. No base sauces here. They're all different. The potatoes weren't masked by the curry. I'm a sucker for Indian eggplant dishes and this one didn't disappoint. The fruit chaat was like a yogurt filled with berry bits and spices. And I mean filled. Loads of fruit in here. I rather enjoyed it. Didn't know frittatas were Indian. This one was tasty though. Also quite fluffy. Big chunk of broccoli on top. The least Indian tasting food we had, but tasty nonetheless. The lamb shank. IT WAS HUGE. Biggest lamb shank I've ever seen. Also tender and smelled incredible. Great indications for taste. I can't say enough good things about it. A bit of the egg, a piece of the lamb, and a bit of the eggplant on a piece of their paratha and you've got one heck of a bite! The leftovers are going to be amazing. And there were leftovers. But then we had dessert. This birthday girl thought ahead. Asked about birthday specials. Secret menu? The key to my heart. Deep fried kulfi. Um... Woah much. We had the fried kulfi (malai/milk flavored) and the paan kulfi (because what is paan?). The paan kulfi was interesting. Was told paan is a leaf that is usually filled with spices and then chewed after a meal. Good to know, but no clue what it should taste like. In my mind, that means I have to try it. It looks like pistachio. It tastes floral and minty and is subtly spiced, but I couldn't tell you with what. It was definitely interesting. The fried kulfi was all about textural contrast. Creamy kulfi with a crunchy fried exterior. Not too sweet. Not too breaded. Very enjoyable. Dessert was free (presumably because birthday) and they still made it beautiful. Long rectangular dish, berry garnishes, gooseberry garnish, cinnamon bark strips, little sprinkles of spices. The aesthetics are just WOW. $30 plus tax and tips for so much amazing food. Bang for buck plus service and ambiance makes this easily one of my new favorite restaurants in Toronto, and I've only had two dishes on the menu. I can't wait to come again and try the rest. I wonder if tomorrow is too soon...",5-star,positive
592,cafes_list,"What a nice place! My favourite was the drink, Goan Green and dessert, the Paan Kulfi! I would visit again just for these two items. For mains I ordered the Haash Bhuna which came with polao, haash bhuna, daal, and pickled eggplant. The portions were really reasonable for the price. For appetizers I had the Chot Puti which was good too. I would like to try all the other appetizers on the menu next time. Customer service was great. The owner Fahim was very helpful. Great place to visit!",5-star,positive
593,cafes_list,"This restaurant truly blew me away. I went with my wife, and we both enjoyed everything. The ambience was really nice, great vibes, great music. We tried a bunch of stuff from the menu. But what impressed me the most were their house made drinks! For Appetizers, we tried the Phuchka and Bihari Sliders, simply mind-blowing! For our mains I had the Chawk's Rissoto. It was probably one of the tenderest Lamb Shanks i've had. It comes with their signature pickle and an eggs fritata. A hearty portion for the price. My wife tried Duck 420, and we've already decided to bring both of our parents to Chawk Bazar to make them try out the Duck. It's the perfect amount of flavor and spice. We were sad to hear they were out their nihari, as I've heard great things about it. So we will definitely go back to try that. I highly recommend this place. Giving it a 10/10. It's the perfect Fusion of South Asian and Comfort food. A heaven for any food lover. The flavors are amazing, the portions are huge, prices are reasonable and atmosphere is really homely.",5-star,positive

The macaroni and cheese was very flavorful as well. However, I was not very impressed with the candied yams. Next time, I will stick with the fries which are well seasoned. The Sweet Tea was BOMB and just how I like it (I prefer my tea very sweet). The service is pretty good. Every time I order, it takes no more than 10 mins for my order to finish.

My husband always orders the fries pork chops and they never bring him a knife. When he ask for one they always bring a butter knife.

I got fried chicken with mac n cheese and fries. The chicken was extremely salty to the point where i couldnt even eat it. The fries tasted like they had been cooked in the same fry bin as fish which made them pretty hard to eat as well. As for the mac n cheese it was bland and not to my liking. On the upside the service was very good, but i can guarantee i wont be back.",2-star,negative

611,cafes_list,"I have yet to have a great experience from this Chicken Box on Sugar creek. (I grew up eating the one on North Tryon with the same owners). My mother gave me the warning not to eat the one on Sugar creek but to continue going to the North Tryon location. Once the locations were combined to the Sugar Creek location, I decided it couldn't be THAT bad anymore. I was wrong. I ordered my usual, Bbq chicken white meat, broccoli casserole, Mac and cheese, and I add a side of rice and gravy. I called it in and sent my boyfriend to pick it up. Once he got home he assured me the employee checked the bag for all the contents. When we finally open every thing we were missing 2 sides (My Favorite two sides! ). Once I finally cooled down, I began eating the chicken and it was awful, looked like they just slapped Bbq onto baked chicken (It used to look like it had been stewing for hours, The meat would fall off the bone) . It's safe to say I will never be back. To think I was in love with this place and spoke so highly of it!",2-star,negative
612,cafes_list,"I love the original Chicken Box on N. Tryon but I decided to stop here because it was closer. I called ahead and spoke with a nice lady on the phone to order a 3pc whiting with cabbage, cornbread and black eyed peas. I told her about the offer on yelp for a free sweet tea with entree purchase and she asked that I just bring it with me and I would be fine. When I arrived the man at the register was in the back and came out complaining about another employee. He said to a client waiting for her order, ""You see what I have to deal with!?"" He and that client proceeded to have an exchange about the other employee's ""attitude"" while 3 other clients awaited his service. Needless to say, the lady in front of me (who was next in line) was displaying perturbed body language, which he completely disregarded. When it was my turn, he asked for my order and I stated that I'd already called in for a pick up order. Instead of asking for my name and looking it up in their system, he proceeded to play a guessing game, that took about a minute and a half. Finally, he asked my name and said it should be out shortly. I informed him of the yelp coupon (that's available with check in) for the sweet tea. He condescendingly stated, ""Ya'll be usin' these old coupons! Here's the coupon we got right now."" He then passed me a folded copy of the menu (yeah,the menu!). I explained him that I was confident it was valid as it was on the yelp page and was only available with check-in. He angrily went and got the tea and told me my total was $8.45. When I pulled out my card he said, ""That will be $9.45."" I explained to him that he'd just given me a different total and he said that was because of the tax. At this point, I didn't want to argue over the dollar. When he brought me my order he complained about the bag, clearly trying to blame the other employee. He got a new bag. I checked my order and started to leave. He said, ""We good?"", instead of offering a genuine apology. At which point, I just walked off. Now on to the food... The whiting was hot and delicious. The cabbage tasted like it had been sitting for days and had a light brown tint versus the typical green color. It had a strange aftertaste. The black eyes peas tasted like they'd been sitting as well and were bland and watery. The cornbread muffin was dry and lackluster. The tea was perfectly sweetened. The one on N. Tryon is always a perfect experience and I'll keep going there as I have been since the 1990s. Avoid this location and drive the extra 5 miles for a fabulous experience.",2-star,negative

If you like to wait up to 45 minutes for ONE dinner plate and enjoy looking at the nonchalant face of the cashier who looks like she hates being there, then by all means, enjoy! I have called to place an order before hand numerous times and every single time I come to pick it up ( I live 5 min away) it is never ready or even close to being ready. It takes me 15 minutes just pay for my preordered meal. Then when they take my money it takes an additional 30 min to actually receive the dinner. I try going at different time throughout the day thinking that I might have missed the lunch rush and will hopefully receive my meal a little quicker. WRONG!! Same thing just minus about 10 min from your initial wait time. The sad part that they actually have good food!! That's why for some strange reason I keep coming back ( not to mention it's so close to my house). The last 3 times I went to order food, I couldn't wait 30 minutes for food and was pretty much forced to leave by choice.

It also took 20 minutes to get my food which seems it could have been sitting out for a while. I really want to love this place. But, today reminded me why I only go 2-3 times a year.

The green beans were bland to me they tasted like canned green beans!!!! The Mac and cheese was just okay not bad or good and the perch was okay as well.

619,cafes_list,"We could not have found a better place for Sunday dinner than Chicken Box. We arrived about noon and there were a lot of people having dinner after church. You order at the counter from the bewildering array of side order items. It was really hard to narrow it down. Ms T and I ordered a two piece and three piece dark dinner respectively with fried okra, black eyed peas, cole slaw, pintos and collards. We chose corn bread muffins as our bread. Wow, I'm getting hungry thinking about it and I just ate. The chicken was very hot, fresh and juicy. The salt was just right. The coating was light, crisp and tender. This is very good straight ahead fried chicken. It is not peppery, either red or black. The sides were all good. Pintos were plain, perfectly cooked, perfect salt, one of my favorite things. The greens had no meat or fat, in fact they have a little sign saying that they do not use pork fat/lard in their cooking, so I guess these greens are pretty healthful. They were mild and flavorful, with perfect salt again. The slaw was a fine Carolina chop with a very good creamy dressing that was slightly but not too sweet with good depth. Black-eyed peas were similar to the pintos, plain, no meat, but flavorful and tender. Ms T did not like the fried okra as well as she usually does. I will have to yield to her expertise, put I liked it. She felt it had been parboiled before frying, leaving it a little soggy. It had mild but nice okra flavor coming through the light coating. The corn muffins had good corn flavor. This was a great meal of southern cookin'. Again, we have found a place that is exactly what Sweetie Pie's in St Louis has the reputation for, but has completely failed to earn. I have no idea when I will ever be in Charlotte again, but I would not say never. When I am, I will eat at Chicken Box. Might have to try the other location. Strong four stars.",4-star,positive

Can white fish be tough? lol I had fried okra ( my fav!) for my side and the taste was just way off! I'm going to blame it on bad greese. Any other time I never have a bad meal at either locations.

More soul food selections then you could imagine. I'm always a bit skeptical about new places though, so I went with a favorite of mine, fried chicken. Now, you may think I'm pulling your leg here, but I kid you not. This place had the BEST fried chicken I've ever tasted! I had the broccoli casserole and mac and cheese as my sides. Never tasted better sides. Even the sweet tea was just purely wonderful. The lady that took our order was as sweet as the tea, couldn't ask for better service.

We popped in for breakfast and sat for 20 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged us. She stomped around, avoiding our gaze with a sour look on her face. Eventually, we told the hostess that we wanted our check, paid for our coffee and juice and left without even ordering. After we moved to Vegas, we decided to try one more time, giving them the benefit of the doubt -- maybe it was just that waitress. Oddly enough, it was the same hostess and we were sat in the same booth, but a different waitress helped us (Sour Puss was working, though.) Our waitress was very nice, but seemed extremely frazzled, even though it wasn't that busy. (though, she did have tables all over the restaurant -- not sure why they don't group the servers' stations more efficiently). We were greeted right away and she did take our order, but after we sat for 25 minutes, she told us she forgot to put in our order and had just done so 5 minutes ago. Another 15 minutes went by and I finally told her that if our order wasn't up, we had to go. (It was only two breakfasts, not a party of 10.) She disappeared into the kitchen and NEVER came back out. About 7 minutes minutes later, the hostess came out and told us our breakfast was free if we wanted to wait (because it was going to take another few minutes to be ready) and that apparently our server didn't remember to put the order in the *second* time. The food was fine. Nothing to write home about. I got the Denver Potato Pancakes and while the flavor was good, they were a bit oversteamed and mushy in the middle. Eggs were solid. Average food, overall. No one ever came back to check on us, to bring us a faux bill, to apologize again... nothing. So we finally just got up and left. I realize they work in a tourist industry and they're betting they won't see most of these people again. With service like this, they're right.",1-star,negative

The hollandaise sauce isnt as ""rich"" as they advertised. My daughter had the classic French toast. That wasn't worth $8 either. The scrambled eggs and bacon that came with it was good and tasty but the french toast was so bland and tasteless, my daughter wouldn't touch it.

636,cafes_list,"I recently had my first experience here after the restaurant's conversion from the old Courthouse Cafe, and was pleased opening with a bowl of hot and savory Chicken & Sausage Gumbo, in which a large amount of rice resided to help absorb the several spices present.

The Orleans Clubhouse Sandwich here needs to be distinguished from its close cousin, the Chicken Clubhouse Sandwich, which is also on the menu. My Orleans Club, packed with both ham and bacon, Smoked Gouda Cheese, lettuce, tomato, and some mayo, on lightly toasted bread, almost did me in. Fresh and tasty as it was, it was comprised of four very large, toothpicked together sandwich sections. At first I removed a toothpick to eat what I thought was a section, only to learn that I had not drilled down low enough, leaving a crucial part behind on the plate. Once properly holding a complete sandwich section in my hand and after aiming it upward to bite down on with my teeth, I was barely able to get my mouth around the whole length. It took awhile, but eventually I finished the entire sandwich, although I hardly needed to. And it was very satisfying, served with good skin-on Fries and fresh strands of cabbage that joined together to fashion a cool Slaw. A bowl of Oxtail Soup overflowing with big clumps of oxtail meat was ordered by my poker-playing friend visiting from Texas, and he pronounced it to be very tasty. It quickly became clear to me that, even more than the Gumbo, the Oxtail Soup here is designed to furnish a complete solo meal. I will keep this in mind when giving it a try myself in the future. The brightened room has a nice new look, and faux leather seating was comfortable. Service was good, except for slow bringing of food to the table after production of the Gumbo. But, in fairness to the cooks and waitstaff, we were dining during the 12 o'clock lunch hour, and just about every seat in the room was occupied. A noticeable improvement over the old coffee shop!",4-star,positive

640,cafes_list,"The so called Aloha Island Specialties menu is anything but that. We ordered the Oxtail soup and the Loco Moco. The rice that accompanied these two dishes was not like anything I ever experienced or tasted before. It was really ""sticky"" rice, more like one big clump of mushed, solid, I don't know what it was, but it wasn't anything I'd ever seen before. So bad. Everyone in the restaurant did not eat the rice. Oxtail soup had absolutely no taste whatsoever, it tasted like just water. No flavor at all. Another, so bad. My friend who ordered the Loco Moco said it was okay, but she also only ate 2 small bites of rice. Rice is 1/3 of a Loco Moco!!! Order from a different part of the menu, but NO rice!!!

641,cafes_list,"Friends were staying at the Orleans this weekend so I was here on back to back nights at 2:00 AM+ in the morning from a long night of Vegas entertaining. I was expecting the Courtyard Cafe and it was A-OK finding the Copper Whisk here...good times. Service: My most recent visits were with the weekend grave shift crew. The Host team was always friendly with getting our groups seated quickly. Our server the other night was great, he with letting us try the macaroni salad before deciding between that or toast. The night before, our server got flustered with our drink orders but in the end she nailed it. Everyone was great with taking care of our group at such a late hour. Late night eats: My first late night out was a cheeseburger with the macaroni salad. Ingredients were good and the burger was prepped well. The following night, I recovered with a Loco Moco that came out on a long plate versus a bowl. I adapted and the gravy was tasty and paired well with the hamburger patty as it should in a loco moco Ambiance: Newly remodeled with this colorful NOLA contemporary theme, chocked full of bright colors, iron bars and trumpet lighting to bring back cool memories I had in the French Quarter. Lots of spacing in the two open dining areas which is 5x better than the seating in the Courtyard Cafe. Well done on the design and theme execution. Pricing is pretty fair to the quality and quantity of food received. However with Vegas becoming a low key foodie capital, you can get much more interesting dishes close by for similar pricing. Compared to the pricing of other casino cafes, Copper Whisk offers great value. You get seated quickly, friendly staff and above average cafe food even at 2 AM+. Copper Whisk is open 24 hours and they just made my list of casino cafe possibilities to recover after a great night of partying. Party safe, recover here if in the area..It's a celebration, enjoy yourself! =)",3-star,negative

I tasted the short ribs and they were great, tender and had a lot of flavor! The staff took a little longer to bring out the spam... Once my plate was out, I was excited to eat since I slept until 1pm, I guess you can say I was ""hAngry"". The waffles were mini waffles with chicken strips which I didn't mind. I thought it was cute that they were tiny! After one bite, I was disappointed. The waffles were really hard, the waffle was covered in syrup and I thought that would've changed it... The skin on the chicken strips were crispy but it was flakey. I tried cutting the chicken into smaller pieces to go with the waffles but the skin was falling off completely. It was a little frustrating... The staff were very attentive, always refilled our water when they seen it was getting low.

656,cafes_list,"We love to stay at the Orleans Hotel, but on our most recent stay, we had a bad experience at the Copper Whisk Cafe. We had great service at Courtyard Cafe, but this was our first time there after the renovations. Our server, Jesse, took our orders. My mother ordered the Country-style smoked salmon with over easy eggs. When our food arrived, the waitress gave her pancakes, scrambled eggs and Scottish bangers. When she questioned the waitress, Jesse insisted she ordered the country fried steak, which was also not what she brought so she offered to ""change it out"". Not wanting to disrupt our plans for the day, my mother just said she'd eat what she was brought. We were all pretty confused and through breakfast we realized the waitress had to have known she messed up, but blamed my mom instead of taking responsibility. So a memeber of our party took it up with the manager, Tony. Tony (a female) raised her voice and said, ""well she ate it didn't she?!"" Which we heard from the table. The manager was unapologetic and very rude. I was very upset with the attitude we were given and decided to call. Unfortunately, Tony picked up my call. When I asked to speak to her boss she gave me his name and hung up on me. I called again, this time asking for Brad Jackson. He was apologetic and offered a $20 comp at any of their restaurants. I appreciate the gesture, but I wasn't complaining for free food, I just never want to run into this problem again. He said he spoke to her, but who knows if anything was done to correct her bad attitude and the waitress' inability to accept responsibility.",1-star,negative

I told her Yelp and she replied with an attitude that ""that's impossible we don't get orders through Yelp"". But as you can see from my screen shot you guys DEFINITELY take orders through there. So I pull up the app on my phone I walk her through to where it shows my order and she STILL insists that this restaurant has no association with Yelp and that she has no idea. She apologized for the wait but like she really didn't care about the problem. And the way you handle talking to customers is appalling. I cannot stand a restaurant that has no idea what's going on.

I decided to take a leap of faith and it's a good thing I did! Turns out the rental was not available and we had to Uber to the clients office at the last minute.

The coffee station did not have the bold flavor available for 30 min. After 25 min, I went up to the counter and asked whether our numbers were ready, they said that they were still making them. Although it was only scrambled eggs and a few pieces of bacon. Still 30 minutes later, food has not arrived... which prompted me to start writing this review. The corner bakery in Hinsdale Illinois, which I have been to in the past, has never treated customers like this. We ended up going to the counter to get a refund and cancel our orders.

When we arrived just before 6pm it seemed strange there was only one other person in the cafe at dinner time for so many. First impression should have told us to leave. The cafe did look clean so I gave it one star for that. We Couldn't get the sandwich we wanted because they were out of chicken. Ok, no big deal, had turkey instead. $18.00. Seemed a little high for two sandwiches and a cup of soup when I saw the sizes of the servings we were brought. I almost ducked as the server plunked our food on the table and walked away without a comment. With four of us at the table it was a shuffle as we had to figure out what was what and who got what. The servers attitude and sour face told us she didn't want to be there and wished we would leave also. My sandwich looked like a child's size sandwich and came without any dressing or flavor. The cup of soup wasn't hot but the other grilled sandwich was. So now I know why so few stars. I won't be back.

After ordering a staff member let me know that they were out of kale and asked if it was okay to replace with kale with mixed greens, I was fine with this. After receiving my plate it looked pretty delicious, but after the first few bite of each salad it was only downhill from there. The pasta in the pasta salad was so overcooked to the point that when I would take a bite of it the mushiness would fall apart in my mouth. Instead of the toasted sesame salad, I received a mixed green salad which included a few croutons and tomatoes and an overly sweet balsamic vinaigrette which was just empty calories. Finally I tried the tuna salad which was the most edible thing on the plate. I'm not sure what they put in it but it was very watery and tasted sweet.

The ethnic diversity of the restaurant choices here equals or trumps that of many larger cities. Caribbean food is no exception, but Cuba has been underrepresented until recently. While we will not anytime soon find ourselves alternating breaths of salty, tropical seaside air and Monte Cristos, we are fortunate to settle for sipping cafe Cubanos and munching on croquettes while overlooking Lake Monona from the Cardinal Bar. Carved into the former coat check area of this nightclub long known for its tropical tunes and dancing -- the music doesn't stop during Sunday brunch -- Cortadito Express offers a modest menu of Cuban choices. I ordered the Dirty Bird sandwich over my typical favorite, the Cubano. The pulled chicken was roasted to perfection, with the slaw providing a sweet, crunchy contrast and the spicy mayo completing a trifecta of textures and flavors. The bread was fresh and toasted just right. The meat croquettes are somehow crispy, yet they melt in your mouth with their cheesy potato filling. I had a bite of my wife's Cuban sandwich. The pork was seasoned just right with a perfect amount of yellow mustard on the same well-toasted bread. I'll order it next time but will skip the side baguette, which unlike the sandwich bread was dry and didn't seem fresh. I also look forward to trying the brunch versions of both sammies, which add an egg to them. Definitely a must if you're in a tropical mood. It hit the spot on this muggy day.",4-star,positive

The staff is super friendly and when we heard how they baked My girlfriend and I ordered the appetizer sampler along with the chicken sandwich-the dirty bird. The appetizer sampler is a great value if you wish to try a few things on their menu. For just over $11, you get an offering of ceviche, freshly made guacamole, chips and two croquettes of two kinds-potato and meat served with a side of delicious aioli. The ceviche was nicely prepared-you could taste the freshness of the fish balanced by the acidity of the citrus it has been marinated in. The guacamole also was well done although scooping it out in the narrow serving dish was a tad difficult. I think the croquettes, however, stole the show. Biting through the brown crispy shell allows you access to the warm, soft potatoey gooey-ness on the inside. Dipping them into the aioli was a decadent treat. The Dirty Bird sandwich is also noteworthy. Served on a cuban roll baked that morning, it is an exciting blend of shredded and marinated chicken, chipotle, jicama, roasted corn, sweet potato, and cilantro with a harisa aoili dressing. It is something I could eat every week and never get bored of. Since the kitchen is located within the Cardinal, there isn't any dedicated seating per-se. Rather, have a seat wherever you like in (or at) the bar and they will bring the food out to you. Since I was already over-caffeinated up from an earlier stop, I did not try any of their coffee offerings but if they are even half as good as their food, I will be a big fan. And with it being open until 3 am on the weekend, I may also be a frequent fan as the food would go well with a few cocktails consumed beforehand. A great find!",5-star,positive
693,cafes_list,"Oooooolé! I don't dabble in The Cardinal Bar very often but now that Cafe Cortadito has opened up shop there (in what apparently used to be the bar's old coat closet), I'll be a regular. From their small space, they dish out delightful meals with a Spanish flair. After a bit of bike riding, my fella and I treated ourselves to their Appetizer Sampler Platter and split The Dirty Bird sandwich. The sampler offered smaller portions of their guacamole and chips, house cured olives, ceviche, croquetas papas and meat croquetas. The croquetas papas were melt-in-your-mouth-and-then-take-a-nap delicious and the ceviche had a light, fresh taste. I'm an olives girl so their house cured ones took the cake for me - a little spice, a lot of salt, a happy Katie. For $11.95, I'd say this was a pretty solid deal considering an order of the ceviche is $8.95 on its own. Share the platter with more than two people though and you might just jeopardize some friendships. You've been warned. The Dirty Bird consisted of chipotle poached chicken thigh with roasted corn, sweet potato, jicama and cilantro slaw all on house-baked bread. Yes. Oh yes. It was a little sweet, spicy and all kinds of nice. Go.there.now.",5-star,positive
694,cafes_list,"Paid $5 for churros & chocolate. Received a small sauce dish of chocolate and limp, oily churros. I'm no churro expert, but these were limp enough that if you picked up one end of the churro, the other would flop over and they were super oily as well. Disappointing.",2-star,negative
695,cafes_list,"Got a gyro bowl here last night. Large chunks of salty meat. Made me think this dish is how they get rid of the end pieces. The restaurant had run out of rice at 8 pm on a Friday night. They replaced with couscous. Vegetables in the bowl were broccoli and carrots. Not great, but staff was friendly and hard working.",2-star,negative
696,cafes_list,"The food is always amazing here! I love it but the last time I came in the cashier was a straight bitch taking orders with a HEADPHONE in her ear the whole time and being rude and impatient with customers who had a thick accent, obviously she works on Fremont so she should know she's dealing with tourists... extremely unprofessional.",2-star,negative
697,cafes_list,"Over priced. Don't get much either. Ordered a chicken shawarma wrap and had to hunt through all the 'filler' veggies to find, at most, 1/4 chicken breast. The hummus appetizer was real good though and their gyros are okay if you're in a bind. Not too bad overall, but it will be some time before I come back.",3-star,negative
698,cafes_list,Probably healthiest and tastiest food on Fremont street. Had the lamb shawarma and greek salad. Very tasty and healthy. Service from Princess and Thalia was top notch. Will return,5-star,positive
699,cafes_list,"Their pesto turkey burger is probably their worst item in the menu if I had to guess. It called to me as something that couldn't miss but the turkey paddy was obviously frozen and not house made, and the trimmings we're just regular with basically tasteless fries. They reminded me of in and out fries that you need ketchup with. The staff was just ok to. I suppose Since I was at a Greek restaurant this was not the best thing to get but at the same time, this was just not worth $10.",2-star,negative
700,cafes_list,For there prices they need to not burn the onion rings and learn how to make a gyro 3 small thin pieces of meat it all feta that they charge you more for no sauce very dry and pita was hard.,1-star,negative
701,cafes_list,"I ate here years ago and remembered it as being good. I tried it again last night and it did not impress. I had the falafel pita. The falafel was not your typical round balls but rather a hamburger shaped patty. The flavor was decent but it was an odd orange color. The pita itself was a bit tough. The way they had it wrapped encouraged eating it from the top down. It had an OK sauce with lots of cucumbers and tomatoes at the top. This helped because there was no falafel pieces to bite in to at the edges of the pita. However, once at the bottom I was left with a pita full of dry lettuce, no sauce, cucumber or falafel left. Overall it was very disappointing. Maybe if I had cut it all up and mixed it first it would have been better?",2-star,negative
702,cafes_list,"Had lunch here on 5/30/16 around 1pm and it was great! I had a chicken bowl, the chicken was juicy and the rice was perfect. I also had some pita and hummus, the hummus was smooth and had a great flavor. Great spot if you are tired of buffets and or other greasy food in Vegas.",5-star,positive
703,cafes_list,Way less crowded than the other places on Fremont. Excellent food choices. Delicious Lamb burger is mouth watering. Also got the Greek wrap with spinach tortilla. Yum. Oh and they have sweet potato fries my favorite! Kudos to the chef!,4-star,positive
704,cafes_list,I just had their beef kabobs with white rice. the meat was very tender and the rice was very good. the portions could be a little bit larger but overall the flavor was there. They probably need to hire one more person at the register it took a little bit longer than expected. I would eat there again overall my experience with 4 out of 5 Stars I guess I would have given it five stars if the portions were a little bit bigger.,4-star,positive
705,cafes_list,"Had the shawarma kabob plate. It wasn't juicy broiled kabab, it was like dry flavorless fajitas. The veggies on the side were over cooked and mushy. I guess people who like this place don't really know how Mediterranean food is supposed to taste. Although the prices are reasonable, don't waste your money.",2-star,negative
706,cafes_list,Surprisingly good fare at an good price. Quick meal early afternoon. Gyro and Greek salad a better alternative to burgers friend or questionable oriental restaurants nearby.,5-star,positive
707,cafes_list,"Sitting at the restaurant now, food has very small portions for the price, no flavor and fries are burnt. Very bland food. Tastes like meat has no seasoning..somewhat a metal taste. Wouldn't recommend to anyone, by far the worst mediterranean food I've has so far!",1-star,negative
708,cafes_list,"Great dinner! Cane here on our first night in Vegas. We did not want to walk down the strip because we were pretty tired. Found this place here on Yelp. My husband and I had the chicken shawarma, which is always a favorite of mine. I forgot what the kids ordered but they loved their meals as well. Friendly gentleman behind the counter who wanted to make sure we had a great experience. My only regret is that we did not cone a second time.",5-star,positive
709,cafes_list,"I ordered a Mediterranean bowl with gyro meat and I must say it was high up there. It contained perfectly tender meat and lightly grilled veggies that were all infused with a delightful oil based sauce.

714,cafes_list,"Let me preface by saying I am middle eastern and very familiar with the cuisine. I almost ordered a gyros sandwich, but noticed a customer eating gyros and realized that it was those paper thin frozen gyros. So I ordered the beef shawarma pita pocket and my husband ordered a falafel wrap. His wrap was filled with veggies, tahini sauce and 2.5 falafels!! You get more falafels in an appetizer! The beef shawarma pita had slightly more meat (all at the bottom of the sandwich), but the spice on the beef shawarma was different, and not in a good way. For those 2 sandwiches and a small drink, we paid $25 and were hungry again in an hour. I understand we're in vegas, but that was soo not worth it. I can't figure out why this place has so many positive reviews.",2-star,negative
715,cafes_list,"This is THE hidden gem on Fremont Street. The owner and staff are so friendly. I've been there three times for lunch in the last two weeks. Yes, it's THAT good. Twice I ordered the shrimp skewers plate. Both times, the shrimp were cooked perfectly! The plate comes with hummus (I think it's a red bell pepper hummus), pita, veggies, and Israeli couscous.... Oh, that couscous. It is SO GOOD! I've made couscous several times and each time, it comes out quite bland. This place works some magic on the couscous because it is really flavorful! The last time I went, I ordered the lentil soup. Upon first sight, I didn't think I'd be impressed. The broth was watery and the lentils whole. I was expecting more like a split-pea soup. But the soup was hearty and delicious. Would highly recommend Cous Cous! (And they serve beer and wine. Bonus.)",4-star,positive
716,cafes_list,"What a refreshing, healthier option while staying in Vegas! There's only so much prime rib and fried foods one can eat, especially a vegetarian and meat eating-non seafood eating husband! We had a delightful meal, sat outside and people watched (whoa!). Great price, too! Highly suggest you check it out!",5-star,positive
717,cafes_list,"After sharing a burger at the heart attack hell next door, we needed something healthy and refreshing to eat. We had the tabbouleh and Gyro and some falafel. All was delicious and the owner was so nice and helpful. Prices are VERY fair for Vegas too.",5-star,positive
718,cafes_list,"I researched this place before our trip, and based on the positive reviews, my wife & I stopped in for a late dinner this past weekend. She got the salmon kabob plate, and I got the chicken gyro. Both were just about the best we've ever had, including our stay in Athens several years ago! We were jonesing to try other menu items after a show the next night. She got the Greek salad, while I got more salmon kabobs to share and the chicken gyro. It was a LOT of food! We ate ourselves into a stupor, but what a way to go! We went back for breakfast the next morning before our trip home. She got the Fattouch salad with grilled shrimp & I got the chicken kabob plate. YUM!!! The prices aren't cheap, but the staff is very helpful. I believe the owner & her Mom waited on us the first two times. They were very sweet during our visits. The salmon kabobs are AMAZING!!! Actually, everything we tried was better than most places we've been to. The tzatziki is creamy with chunks of cucumber, and the hummus tastes homemade. Given that the heart attack grill is next door, this is the much better option.",5-star,positive
719,cafes_list,SUPERB! Caprese is out of this world and we had 2 sandwiches the size of a whale. Only draw back was the bread was a bit tough. This is not normal bread tho but the sandwiches had TONS of meat on them. Try this small place. It sure beats anything else on Freemont.,4-star,positive
720,cafes_list,"I am really torn about reviewing this little shop. On the one hand, the girl at the counter was really nice, and the guy who made my sandwich was great about adding whatever I wanted. Additionally, the sandwich was actually pretty delicious and fresh which was totally unexpected from a Fremont Street/DT Vegas chain on a Sunday night. On the other hand, I asked to add pepperoni (got peperoncini at first, then added the right thing) and I asked for NO CHEESE. This is not a fancy-person affected lifestyle choice: I am highly allergic to dairy products. The first half of my sandwich was delicious and amazing and as I ordered. The second half had cheese, and I could have died. So... Three stars? ... and a recommendation that they read order slips more carefully.",3-star,negative
721,cafes_list,"I really loved this place when it opened and was happy to have a high quality sandwich and med place across the street. Unfortunately since originating management has left the place has rapidly gone down hill. My sandwiches are now about 1/2 the meat and less attention to quality as before and the prices have gone up. I sure they will make up in the transient crowds but its sad to see them squeeze every buck versus having consistency and quality. I just paid $7+ for a sandwich that should have cost about $4.50. I wish them luck, they lost a local.",1-star,negative
722,cafes_list,"Awful experience. Put a to-go order in about an hour ago and still waiting. While waiting, watched one person send back their order because it was wrong. They waited another 20 minutes for the revised order. Just watched the cashier get 'fountain drink' for a customer...she cracked open a CAN of diet soda and poured it in the glass. Shall I go on? I could have gone to the mediterranean and gotten a meal there faster than waiting for this place. How hard is it to make a wrap???",1-star,negative
723,cafes_list,"I really hope they advertise to the rest of the downtown residents bc THIS PLACE IS GREAT! The owner Renatto is awesome, and really wants you to have an excellent experience. You have to try the scallop kabobs with couscous and the strawberry gelato pita! Also, they're open with full kitchen until midnight and you can byob :) I'll definitely be going back soon!",4-star,positive
724,cafes_list,"You really have to be looking for this place to find it, but it's definitely worth checking out. It's located in Neonopolis just west of the Heart Attack Grill. The place is tiny and cute, and the food is classified as Mediterranean, and made to order. Menu items include: pitas, skewers, soup (gazpacho, lobster bisque), sandwiches, coffee, gelato, and assorted other desserts. I decided to try the lobster bisque; the soup was pretty good - It's rare to see lobster bisque on a menu in Vegas, and it was just what I wanted now that the weather is getting cooler. Since the place is so small, it's only natural to strike up a conversation with the other patrons since you're practically sitting together, which is a refreshing change from the surrounding bars and casino restaurants. If you come across this place, stop in and check it out.",4-star,positive
725,cafes_list,"Absolutely love this place. The staff are always super friendly and helpful, and they have a great selection of beverages that taste fantastic (seriously, I haven't had one I didn't like, and I've had like 20 different ones.) They also have a myriad of events throughout each month--everything from guest chefs cooking burgers to live music. The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet, and a great place to meet up with a friend for conversation. My favorite drink here is an iced P.A. Cubano, which is sweetened with Pennsylvania maple syrup, but I am also a big fan of their teas, of which they have a huge variety. As far as food, I'd say the best of their sandwiches is the prosciutto one, and their waffles with berries absolutely hit the spot every time. The chai-baked oatmeal is also a great snack. Bottom is if you're looking for a place to hang with someone in the Strip District, sip tasty drinks, and maybe have a snack, this is the place.",5-star,positive
726,cafes_list,"One of my favorite places on the strip. Staff is kind and courteous and the coffee and food are great. The ""feel"" is relaxing and the decor is great. I have had several different coffees and they all have been great. Breakfast always hits the spot and the prices are very reasonable.",5-star,positive
727,cafes_list,Great place to have coffee or boba tea. It is in and out and it is an old garage. Nice decor and good place for studying. I usually bike here so I am not sure about good car parking. Definitely has good bike parking. The stuff is friendly and the food I have not tried yet.,5-star,positive
728,cafes_list,"Went here for coffee and a small breakfast for my birthday, and we will be back! The staff were so friendly and my latte was amazing! The food was very flavorful, we got a pink tarte, basically a large macaron with fresh raspberries and a breakfast panini, i wish we had gotten more! The coffee was so flavorful! The chocolate for my latte was really good! The staff were so knowledgeable about coffee and seemed very passionate. They even had a small kid play area which was so nice!",5-star,positive
729,cafes_list,"So sad that I discovered this place so late in the game! My friend and I came here to get some work done and the productivity level was so high. The atmosphere is calming. Lots of natural floods the two-story shop. The menu selection has a nice variety and is rather affordable. We sat upstairs and absolutely loved it! We both had the grilled cheese which was excellent. I tried the maple cortado, and it was lovely. Then I purchased a carafe (20oz) of coffee for only $5! My only regret is that I wish I would've found this shop sooner.",5-star,positive
730,cafes_list,"Love this place! Huge upgrade on the previous coffee place that was in this space. There is a fair amount of seating (main floor, upstairs balcony, and three sidewalk tables) and the overall coffee-shop design is a clean and simple industrial look. Love little touches like the milky pastel colors for the chairs and coffee cups, lots of natural light, interesting art, etc. Staff is EXTREMELY kind, attentive, and engaging, especially if it's not super busy. Quiet during the day, even if the garage door is up and street noise intrudes. Coffee drinks are good. Definitely not as fussy as some places, and there are some interesting sweeter options (cortado with maple syrup and their affogato, for instance). They have a limited menu (some breakfast items, panini, meat/cheese plates, and toast), but also have periodic burger nights. They also usually have some interesting pastry options in the case. Definitely highly recommend the yeasted buckwheat waffle with fresh fruit, whipped cream, and a drizzle of maple syrup. Unexpectedly light, slightly crispy, and not at all too sweet. They also have a cocktail menu, wine, and beer, which I haven't fully explored, but the Tango Nuevo cocktail is of particular note for how awesome it is. Small kitchen/play area for kids, which I think is a really nice touch and helps to welcome a different set of customers into the space. They have live music nights periodically. These definitely get noisy and the staff encourage the customers to pay attention to the acts/do less chatting...so if you're headed to De Fer on a live music night, it's probably not going to be the best time for an intimate conversation with the person across the table. But they're great and feature a pretty wide mix of styles/performers with a vague thematic element to curate the overall event. For laptop folks--the outlet situation isn't awesome throughout parts of the space, so that's something to be aware of if you're planning to camp. Overall, I find it a very welcoming, bright, and thoughtfully managed place!",5-star,positive
731,cafes_list,"A beautiful space, friendly service, but my drink was of extremely poor quality. I ordered a cortado, which is something that you can find beautifully prepared at almost every well-known craft coffee shop in this city (which there a number of) and I was very disappointed to find the milk steamed quite poorly. I won't pretend to be able to taste espresso clearly through milk, but even that seemed to be rather sour. Additionally, I found it odd that the cortado was not served in a clear glass (something which you traditionally find in most shops) but this is just a matter of personal preference. I think they need to spend some time on barista training. I will reiterate that the staff was extremely kind and attentive. My point is this: it is no secret that this place poached this former location of the excellent (although historically notorious for customer service) 21st Street Coffee and Tea. Nevermind my fondness for the former business, I would remain wary of an establishment that selectively engages with a community, but runs out other local businesses for its own benefit, and then can't quite deliver on the goods.",2-star,negative
732,cafes_list,"Last time I went to this location, it was literally an entirely different cafe with a different look, feel, service, foods and beverages. I can honestly say that De Fer is an upgrade to what once was. The interior design is open and inviting, with brick walls contrasted with brightly colored art and seating. There are flowers at each table and even a playroom for kids. Not only do they sell espresso drinks, but they also sell baked goods, merch and other goods! The baristas are very very very friendly, nice and super helpful! They were patient and non-judgmental of all my questions and curiosities. Frankly, this is rare among coffee shop culture. The coffee was pretty good, though the espresso wasn't as deep or bitter as I personally would have liked but to each their own! The syrup, made on-site, is not too sweet but prominent enough. Would definitely come here a gain!",5-star,positive

736,cafes_list,"I used to make 21st Street Coffee my go to Sunday morning spot. The baristas were passionate and knowledgeable about coffee and took their time to make sure the drink was perfect before it would hit the counter. De Fer has the right idea with the menu and decor but needs barista training. Shots are pulled incorrectly (they have a scale and timers but not used) and drinks (particularly the mocha) needs a lot of work. Way too sweet, almost undrinkable, and the the milk wasn't even steamed correctly. (No micro foam, very Starbucks like mix mash of some milk and espresso). There's a lot of competition in Pittsburgh. Great coffee shops, talented baristas, and coffee consumers that raise the bar in quality and expectation. De Fer needs to get off on the right foot by surrounding themselves with passionate people. Especially in such an iconic location.",2-star,negative
737,cafes_list,The barista was FRIENDLY AND OUTGOING!! A first that I have seen. The typical staff I run into at local coffee shops treat you like you interrupted their instagram post. The cortado was amazing and so was the london fog. Atmosphere was lovely. We will be back.,5-star,positive

The pastries were amazing - I'm a huge fan of almond croissants and I can say that the almond croissant I had here was one of the best I've ever eaten. The service was great as well. The table my friend and I were sitting at was very wobbly, and the workers came right away and fixed the table for us. The coffee is kind of expensive - an iced latte is 4.25 for only 10 oz, but the quality is good and they have lots flavors.

While De Fer makes better use of the space than the prior tenant, the coffee comes at slightly higher price point than before. We ordered the drip coffee and white peony tea, both of which were tasty but nothing to write home about. Extra points for the friendly & knowledge staff, as well as the little chocolates they give with each drink order. I'd certainly come back to explore the very reasonable priced food and alcoholic drink menu, which sets them apart from the other coffee shops in the city.",4-star,positive

744,cafes_list,"Love this new coffee/ tea spot in the Strip! Located on Smallman, it's nice that it's a bit behind the chaos that is Penn Ave. I came here two weeks ago, around 3:45pm, without knowing that they close at 4:00pm. I ordered oolong tea, admired the art on the walls, and got comfy. I checked in on yelp and freaked out a little when I saw that they were closing in a few minutes. Vanessa, who owns the shop with her husband, was working and was SO incredibly kind when I asked her if I needed to leave, since they were closing. Since some other customers were in the shop talking and hanging out, Vanessa said it was fine for me to stay too, as it takes a while to break down all of the machines and clean them. How sweet is that? I was able to sip my delicious tea for 45 minutes and work on some school work and enjoy the calming ambiance of this gorgeous shop. I really appreciated that. Not only is this a coffee/tea shop, but it's a little market! They have tons of local items like honey, bread, oils & vinegars, jams, salt, baked goods, and everything you would need to brew the perfect cup of tea or coffee at home. Not only that, but De Fer is planning on having cocktails and wine in the next upcoming months as well! Once that happens, the hours will be extended. What an awesome concept. Truly a beautiful coffee shop, in a great location, with fantastic owners. Can't wait to come back.",5-star,positive

They also have a cool assortment of locally made food items ranging from maple syrup to pasta to pickles. The space is large yet still cozy and inviting. Seating was somewhat limited when we went on a busy Sunday afternoon. They now roast their coffee on the atrium overlooking the shop so you have a great view of the process.",5-star,positive

Unbeknownst to us, this place just opened last week or so, but it was still a nice spot. Plenty of seating, clean, updated, and friendly staff. My friend got a cortado and I got a chai tea latte. Both were good. If you're in the area, definitely stop in!",4-star,positive
748,cafes_list,"A good, new, independent 3rd Wave Coffee joint with a bunch of enthusiastic folks behind the counter in the former 21st Street Coffee location. The specialty drinks lean towards the sweet. There's a cortado on the menu, but it's suburban, with maple sugar and whipped cream. The menu will be expanded to include food. Big blank slate boards on the wall suggest they're planning ahead. Exceptionally spacious, the location seems to encourage lingering. The chairs and tables aren't quite cozy but, it'll no doubt be a fine coffice for more than a few freelancers. Roasting equipment may move in upstairs, I hear. De Fer will not only be blending and roasting beans, but teas. Indie tea blenders are too rare these days. On a slow second-to-opening day, I was offered a taste two distinct espressos, ordered a cortado with one, bought a bag of beans of the other. The bag's blend, Sons of Vulcan, is a reference to steel workers, but also Star Trek, in my mind. It lent itself well to tiramisu.",4-star,positive

We got a roast beef sandwich and a turkey/brie sandwich. While the sandwiches were good, I do think they are over priced. Then again it is midtown so I didn't expect cheap... We also got some of the candy lego blocks for our son, which he had a ball with (I know I can get these other places but because there was something there for him, made me happy).

756,cafes_list,"This may not be as expansive as the flagship D&D in SoHo, but the ambiance is just as spectacular. While listening to the ever elegant classical soundtrack D&D plays, I enjoyed a small custom salad coupled with a decadent prosciutto sandwich. The mixed greens used in the salad were crisp and vivacious, the prosciutto thinly sliced- just as it should be-and thoughtfully draped over disks of fresh mozzarella, a true sensory overload. After your lunch at D&D, you'll feel fully rejuvenated, as if you had spent a day at the spa. As for the service, every chef I spoke with was nothing short of amicable and disposed to offer a menu selection. They were well versed on the myriad of products offered and even followed up after my lunch on how I enjoyed the new San Pellegrino flavor That I tried for the first time. Anyone who is in search of a new daily lunch spot, this is without a doubt the place to be.",5-star,positive

758,cafes_list,"I got the Portobello Panini (Portobello mushrooms, red peppers, mozzarella, basil mayonnaise) as a late lunch one weekday afternoon. The sandwich was ok but nothing special. For $10, it wasn't a satisfying meal. I was also disappointed by the peanut butter M&A bar that I got as a dessert. It looked delicious, but had very little taste. Probably won't be returning here.

This is a good alternative for those who just don't want to wait in those hour long Starbucks lines.

Although I typically choose a sandwhich, of which I have tried a few, the turkey and avacado, caprese and the french dip special, I have also enjoyed some of their soups. Among my favorite, the lobster bisque, a warm and think lobster creme base that is just perfect on a chilly day.

772,cafes_list,"I'm a D&D fan, it's always a sure thing. But after opening the bottle of wine I'd purchased to accompany my dinner, I was heartbroken to discover what appeared to be a leaky cork and a bottle that had gone bad. I know this isn't the best place for wine, but I think I could have gotten better cared for wine at a gas station. And my fellow winos out there can relate to the feeling of anticipation of that first sip after a long day, only to be met with bitter disappointment. Also, a bit disappointed in the selection of grocery items. I realize it's just a cafe, but the acres of shelf space dedicated to repetitive merchandising of candy could be used for more variety. Caprese salad could have used much more basil as well. I'll stick with my usual D&D from now on.",2-star,negative

The staff is incredibly friendly and quality products accompany that friendliness. I feel fancy coming here. If D&D focused strictly on coffee, they'd put Starbucks to shame. Alas, they do not and for that I thank them. The food is really good and so is the coffee. Stop by and do not pass up the chicken and dumplin' soup.",4-star,positive
774,cafes_list,"I love coming to D&D for lunch! What I love about this place is the consistency. YES it is pricey but I am a big fan of price/value balance. I usually get the Small Asian Salad with chicken (and extra crunchies) and it is $9.99 without tax. Expensive yes, but this IS worth it! I walk out and I know I have a ten dollar salad but it is worth every penny. It is huge and is always fresh. The greens are never nasty which can sometimes happen at Just Fresh. The chicken is marinated and never gross. It comes with mandarin oranges too. I eat every last bite and it is so delicious. The soups are fantastic if you dont think you are going to work late and therefore do not need much of a lunch. Fiesta Chicken is a huge favorite!! It has a little kick to it so if you are tired of sitting in the office being refrigerated all day, get this soup and you will thaw right out! Love you D&D!",5-star,positive
775,cafes_list,"I think I found another staple in Charlotte. My first visit was an afternoon coffee to get a break from the office and stay awake the rest of the day. My latte reminded me of the days I would take the same afternoon walk from the office to Eatzie's in Atlanta. Very well done. I also grabbed a rice krispie bar and a bag of chocolate covered caramels. Impulse buy but I couldn't resist. The fresh dessert selections were just too overwhelming to decide! I was disappointed to find that my bag of caramels contained corn syrup but this one small offset wasn't enough to deter me from a second visit. My husband walked over and met me after work a couple days later. Just note, they close at 7:00 M-Th and 5:00 on Friday. The selections are winding down for the day so if you want to get the full experience lunch time is the best time to go. We ordered take away chicken quesadilla and chicken kabobs. I honestly have not tasted a quesadilla done quite that way but it was a delightful new twist. The chicken kabobs had a flavoring that reminded us of one of our favorite finds of at a restaurant in Waikkiki Beach, HI. Yum! We also made out with a $10 bottle of Malbec. It is a small space but I'll definitely be back because there is still a great selection to choose from!",5-star,positive

While I've never actually been to the original Dean & Deluca in New York City, I've been to their Napa Valley location several times and it is quite and impressive store: a colorful aisle with fresh vegetables and fruits, an aromatic display of various cheeses, and a beautiful display of breads and pastries it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. This Charlotte location is tiny in comparison, but they made me a beautiful Italian sandwich to go and, while it was somewhat pricey at $9, the sandwich was ample enough to allow me to eat only half and save the rest for the next day.

779,cafes_list,"Wow! I really wanted to like this place, but I was so very disappointed! My husband and I came here for breakfast and we both said we won't be coming back. When we first walked in they was no greeting. We should have known we were in trouble when we saw the sign that said they were out of pancakes today! And it was 9 o'clock in the morning! WTH? So we ordered our food and I had ordered coffee. She forgot to add the coffee in. We finally made it to our seats I got my coffee and then I took a look at the hot sauce bottles and they all looked disgusting. It was as though the hot sauce bottles were old and dirty. When our food came my French toast was cold my husband's waffle was cold and the butter didn't even melt either one. Our food was just OK nothing to write home about at all. We will not be coming back I can't tell you how disappointed I was because I was really looking forward to a cute nice breakfast with my hubby. Oh yeah, the service was not that good either. After I sent my French toast back they never came back to check to see if I liked the new French toast. Just bad all around. The food did look very pretty as you can see by my photos but maybe we ordered the wrong thing but we did not like it.

The coffee (which was scarce by 1030am) smelled and tasted gross. However, the biggest upset was the red velvet cupcake my daughter insisted I buy at the end of the meal. The cake part was dry and the icing was still frozen, the cupcake certainly wasn't made fresh that day.

808,cafes_list,"In short, this place is EXCELLENT. I am VERY selective when it comes to breakfast so if you're deciding between two places hope this helps. We ordered a breakfast burrito and the French toast with mixed berries ~ both were delicious. At $4.99 the breakfast burrito is a steal but more important than the value, was the taste. The eggs were fluffy, potatoes cooked perfectly, bacon crisp (as requested) and cheese perfectly portioned. (One of my biggest pet peeves is the overuse of cheese to mask the shortcomings of other ingredients.) Beyond the quality, I also really appreciated the craftsmanship of the burrito. All the ingredients were assembled to perfection and beautifully balanced (see pic) vs. overwhelmingly big and hard to eat (ie: falling apart). If I lived around here this would be my go-to order. The French toast was also solid. Nicely sized bread/ thickness and favorable texture (no soggy edges here). Most notable however were the mixed berries I requested as the topping. They were impressive - envision a farm fresh, high integrity compote. I honestly wasn't expecting that level of quality from the fruit but it was a welcomed surprise. Beyond the food, the service was great. Friendly and helpful. I really appreciate it when the staff proactively inquires if you'd like your plates split. They portioned our French toast for us to avoid the hassle of taking turns on bites (my mom and I were sharing both of the orders). Atmosphere is cute-ISH. Nothing to write home about but absolutely fine for what it is. In truth, if you consider the cost/QUALITY of our meal (roughly $15) the atmosphere is very nice. We didn't sit outside but I like that they have the option. My only ""meh"" comment is regarding the croissant I got to go. It wasn't a top pick. In fairness I waited a few hours post bfst to eat it (that probably contributed). Didn't rank highly so if you're thinking about pastries or a real bfst - I'd encourage going the protein route. Get the burrito! All in all, this will be a DEFINITE must hit every time I'm in town. Tip* Be sure to check if they have a free coupon via YELP - I scored a free coffee when we went. Eat up and ENJOY! This place is AWESOME.",5-star,positive

Still 50/50 chance your order is messed up. I didn't think it was possible but the service is now slower. Plus there's the older woman who works behind the counter that constantly coughs like she has emphysema. They're constantly out of straws and their new thing is they always forget to unlock one of the doors when they open. It's a different door every morning so it turns into a fun guessing game.

Yes they have their whole hot and ready thing going for them but DUNKIN doesn't just give you a donut, it gives you an experience. Hand frosted works of art made by only the finest staff leave you itching for more each and every time. I walked into this DUNKIN Donuts and was immediately blown away by the aromas of freshly cooked dough and smiles. My cashier was such a sweet young girl named Emma who was truly passionate about her job. Before I even ordered she asked me if I was interested in purchasing a medium french vanilla iced coffee with cream and sugar; she READ MY MIND!!! That's how good they are. if I've learned anything over the years it's that there are 2 goals you should try to achieve - 1. Be the best grandma you can possibly be ( bake lots of cookies ;) ) 2. Love what you do and do what you love. Dunkin captures all of this on a daily basis, now that's something special. Roll tide ladies!",5-star,positive
816,cafes_list,"I was traveling from Charlotte to the mountains on 77 and stopped at this Dunkin Donuts for coffee as it is not far off the highway. Two employees were on shift and no other customers were in the store when I arrived. It took a few minutes for one of the two employees to approach the cash register to take my order-which seemed to be an unnecessary wait. I ordered an iced caramel latte which is a pretty straight forward menu item. After waiting about ten minutes at the counter with an unwrapped straw in hand, the same guy that took my order asked if I was waiting on anything. He had literally taken my order and then forgotten about it moments later. He did apologize when I reiterated my order but acted as if it was the first time he had heard of my wanting a latte. It took the guy three times to make my drink. The first time, he left out the caramel. The second time, he dumped the drink out after it was made. It was on the third attempt that he was able to hand off the beverage to me. Mind you, I know about his failings due to his cursing and dropping the ""F"" bomb with every other action behind the counter. The finished latte was pretty underwhelming. The overly abundant caramel syrup wasn't mixed well and tasted pretty artificial. The drink lacked whipped cream and caramel drizzle on top. I have worked at several Dunkin Donuts as a shift leader throughout high school and into my first year of college. This store is an embarrassment to the brand due to the general lack of service, attention and skill displayed through this interaction. Train your employees to competently make menu items. Demand nothing less than excellent customer service. Send your employees home if they're too high to function at work.",1-star,negative
817,cafes_list,"Off to a bad start. This was my second time visiting this new location and both times I received service from the same girl. Everybody is pretty young, which I guess you'd expect...and in general everyone was kind of just standing around hanging out. This isn't really what bothered me though, because at least those who were just chilling were somewhat friendly. Now I have come to not expect much in the way of customer service these days, but there's a line and my cashier was definitely on the ""I'm getting on yelp"" side of it. While I was standing in line the other cashier was helping a couple in front of me and I wasn't even sure my cashier was open because she was just standing there. Finally she says ""can I help you?"" No smile, completely monotone, she didn't even lift her head to look at me! I had to ask if she was even talking to me. To which she replied ""yea."" Still no eye contact. When I asked what kind of bagels they had (wasn't wearing my glasses so I couldn't see the options), she pointed with the lamest, saddest arm I've ever seen and said ""what we have down there."" Then when the transaction was over I couldn't even tell because she didn't say anything...not bye, not have a good day, not see you next time, not thank you...nada. No effort or any kind of desire to offer me even the bare minimum kind of service...which, like it or not, is literally your job. I called the first time a fluke and gave this location a second chance, but without adequate customer service training for their employees I would rather not deal with the bad attitude and spend my money elsewhere.",2-star,negative

I walked in and a gal stood up and looked at me like ""what do u want"", and was apparently the owner? Still not sure...I paid at the register and sat, waited for my breakfast sandwich. I probably would've ordered a coffee or drink but I felt rushed and just kind of forgot, and she never asked if I needed anything else.

Rosemary potatoes were the best I've ever had, perfectly seasoned, crispy and dark on the outside, soft and sweet inside. Five stars for food, service and ambience. It's a quiet, cozy place with soft and romantic ambience. Great place for a quiet conversation. One mild complaint for me was that the air in the restaurant was too warm for me and it really needed more circulation, so If I were the proprietor I would add ceiling fans which would have made my experience absolutely perfect.

I wanted to order sparkling water (Perrier) they didn't have anything like it. The salad came and I was glad the dressing was on the side. It had a terrible taste. I asked if they had another dressing. He brought me a bottle of balsamic vinegar. They only have one dressing. We were given the check without asking if we might have wanted dessert or coffee. I wanted to order a cappuccino. He said the machine was broken. It was a terrible experience, I won't go back. A woman sat inside the whole time and not once did she come and check on us.

There were multiple wait staff, they weren't that busy. Took forever to get our bill. We ordered the ruben and caprese on ciabbatta, fabulous.

Her omelette was so under cooked that the egg was actually liquid on the inside. Both of our bacon had a strange after taste that led us to believe that it was very old or possibly freezer burnt. The muffin were both burnt. After about 15 minutes and our server never checking in with us i approached who I believe is the manager at the front and told her about the issues with the food. Her exact response was ""that's impossible"". At that point I told her that the food was a health risk and that we were leaving. We left a tip on the table and left. We went here because of some of the good reviews, but it appears that this place is going downhill. They cut back their menu offering significantly and apparently can't even cook eggs properly now.

For this, I give it both stars. We chose a seat by the window, with a pretty view of a fountain. That's where the good part ends. When we ordered mimosas to start the server informed us the have pomegranate fruity ones. No problem, I love a good mimosa. When it was delivered it seriously tasted like a very rich fruit juice. I asked her to please top my glass off with champagne and she brought me less than an ounce in a flute. Totally ripped off on the My husband ordered an omelet and I ordered the eggs Benedict, potatoes crispy. I emphasized CRISPY! When the food was delivered our potatoes must've been soaked in olive oil before cooking. They were soggy but flavorful, albeit super fattening. My Benedict had a slice of tomato between the Canadian bacon and the muffin so my muffin was totally soggy! My husband said his omelet was ok but no where near as good as all the other places around. I'm surprised because they are located across the street to our favorite breakfast place (The General Store) which has great quality food at a good price. Ok, so back to the final check!

The only real positive was the space which was nicely done, But with an odd grouping of tables - mostly six or eight tops? To start, our server did not know anything about the menu. My wife ordered a glass of wine, and it was the smallest pour I have seen in a restaurant. She is a small person, but her chicken with corn and arugula was so small she headed for our fridge when we got home. My 40 cloves of chicken was good but two chicken thighs for $22 was way over priced. Also there was confusion with the waiter as to what else came with it. - a small portion of bread or potatoes and beans? When finished we asked for the desert menu and was told they had no deserts but we should look at the breakfast menu? The menu is mostly interesting, but a lot of work needs to be done with the servers, the portions and total execution.

Sometimes my quesadilla is $4 and sometimes it is $6.50, again, same food (no sides, no meat ... just a Cheese quesadilla). IDK, it's things like this that eventually drive away customers and makes it not worth going and eventually they will go out of business - like the little deli that used to be here in the building next door.

The salad was big and tasty, but I'm sensitive to preservatives and ended up with a raging headache by the end of the day.

The time changes from 9pm to 10pm and runs till Midnight so cal and check. Their menu changes frequently but you can get a glass of wine for $5, beers from $2, and cocktails from $6. Hard to beat those prices.... Their food options are also very reasonably priced: $4-$6. I believe the Happy Hour menu is served at the bar upstairs, but you can still order from the regular priced menu. This place is a quaint little three story house which has been converted to a restaurant. Top floor has red painted walls, which look pretty cool. We sat at the bar upstairs (no elevator), and ordered wine and a Moscow mule. There was no dearth of vodka in the MM and the bartender was super friendly and attentive!

Not expansive, but doesn't feel small, either, even with 40 people packed in to one room. The staff are exceedingly courteous and, even though our party was bigger than expected, still made room for everyone to sit. And now, most importantly: The food. I've tried multiple dishes here. The baked goat cheese is probably my favorite. It was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and came with fantastic bread. The calamari was similarly great, although I'm categorically not as big a fan of calamari. The roasted mushrooms were rich and juicy, and I couldn't get enough. The brussels sprouts melted in my mouth and could have been an entire entree on their own. For entrees, the macaroni and cheese (which they kindly made without chorizo as I don't eat sausage) was scrumptious, and came with a fantastic grape jam on top. The tofu dish (I forget the exact name) had a delicious spice crust that elevated it. For dessert, I've tried the banana bread pudding and the coffee-orange creme brulee. Both were fantastic. I dislike coffee and still found the coffee-orange creme brulee amazing. I am so excited to return, and we'll see how things are when I get some more choice of dish!",5-star,positive
867,cafes_list,"There was a group of 5 of us that visited here for happy hour. We missed it by 30 minutes. Instead of just leaving we decided to stay, have a drink and browse the menu. This was all of our first time here. Although we didn't eat I wanted to review because we didn't get that great of service while we were there. It was somewhat busy and despite only getting drinks, we waited close to 20 minutes to be served. I don't want this one time to be a spoiler for the future but it seems this place isn't good for medium sized groups. Maybe if it were two of us it would have been better. To sit and have to find parking and then have subpar service sucks. The waiter, although somewhat nice, wasn't no where as apologetic as the hostesses were. I ordered a Paloma and it wasn't all that great. It was a new drink off their new menu. I think we should go back to the drawing board kids.",2-star,negative

Felice serves up delicious small plates from their happy hour menu, and their full menu looked extensive (I'll have to give that a try next time). Felice is located in the Larchmere neighborhood area in an old, three-story house. It reminded me a lot of parts of Tremont, but had a more suburban feel to it. I ordered the Veggie Kofta tacos, and was delighted with the crispy, perfectly seasoned kofta in the middle of a substantial pita-like taco shell. The vegetables and tahini were the perfect topping to cap this Mediterranean-inspired dish. Two of these babies and I was ready to take on the night! I topped it off with a $3 platform porter. The owner happened to be around Felice when I went in; she was extremely friendly and sparked good conversation; I got a very homely feel.",5-star,positive

Ate here before an Indians game (just ~15 minute easy shot to downtown). All seating was outdoor, and it was eclectic, rustic industrial vibe. Only improvement area is that seats aren't incredibly comfortable and it was a bit buggy (a few ants joined us at the table). The food was delicious, albeit expensive, especially for Cle. We had 3 appetizers and 4 entrees in the group of 4. You could easily go here just for appetizers and drinks since their ""starters"" menu options were all amazingly delicious. We ordered a veggie tart, the house pizza, and sautéed brussel sprouts. Apps are around $8-10 each. Entrees are around $18-30 each and also tasty. The staff was friendly and Margaret, the owner, even came out and greeted the tables. As we were leaving, it was neat to see people walking from around the neighborhood to dine here- true local gem. If you're driving - watch out - street parking only, but there were tons of street spots when we arrived.",5-star,positive

The creative menu i guess threw me off a bit and the location compared to the rest of the great restaurants i have been to made me put this one off to the side... We have a friend who is vegetarian, and in looking for a place to accommodate both i reviewed the menu and suggested it.. Surprised to find out my vegetarian friend has never been here either.. This will not be our last time here that is for sure.... First off Margaret the owner is fabulous, she decided to get in to the restaurant business at 79 and 8 years later still going strong! For starters we had the cheese plate, sauteed calamari and brussel sprouts... The cheese place was amazing and well worth the 14 bucks, the calamari was so tender we will now call it calamari flavored pasta, its that good and tender.. The Brussel sprouts were good as everybody who ate them loved them, i did not.... I had the patty melt for my entree and wow.. The burger a bit over cooked still packed so much flavor it was delicious. My wife had the chorizo mac and cheese, which surprised me as she doesn't tend to like spicy... At the end she was wishing she had enough to take home because the chorizo was sooo good, but only scraps remained... My friends had the polenta which she raved about and her husband the fish tacos... Who uses swordfish in fish tacos, i will have to try next time because they looked and from what he said tasted amazing... Can not wait to come back here,",5-star,positive

877,cafes_list,"Some things pretty good, others particularly awful. Was excited about this place. I and a friend had the 3 course for 25, with an extra starter of oysters. My friend is deathly allergic to honey and carrots and tells the waitress this upfront. Oysters, gazpacho and octopus all pretty good, not mind blowing, but pretty good. The gazpacho was maybe pretty good plus. We both got the porkchops which come on a bed of rice cooked in red stuff and greens [edit: was talking to my wife and she pointed out that they never asked us how we wanted our chops]. Apparently the red stuff includes carrots. Both orders of chops come with carrots cooked in with the rice. My friend notices them in time due to years of habitual checking and we avoid an ER trip (we did, foolishly, leave his epi-pen at the hotel, shame on us) and returns his 'chop. Now, his 'chop had a line of browning on one edge and by the bone but my chop was almost totally brown and hard on one side. You'd think knowing both chops were going to the same table you'd burn both and make them look the same, but nah. Then to top it all off the ""steak knives"" which are really butter knives are just not enough to cut the 'chop. I'm shaking my hipster outdoor metal table all over the place trying to cut my 'chop and leave after they tried to kill my friend. Dear Felice, Get some actual steak knives. Especially if you intend to serve burned 'chops. Dessert. My friend sent his entree back and they took it and his starter off the bill. He skipped dessert lest it have surprise honey in it. I had the ginger-something cheesecake but could not detect any ginger. It had orange colored fruity stuff (maybe apricot?) and berries around it that was ok. The cheesecake itself wasn't any better than what you get at Aladdin's but the plate was prettier and you could smoosh it in the schmear, meh. Very underwhelmed. As usual, I shoulda had the bacon cheeseburger. Waitress was kind of around when we needed/wanted her. Guy refilling water was on point. Drinks: again pretty good but not mind blowing",1-star,negative

Since the ownership shift, I'm not sure if the happy hour is the same, but the first time I was here for it, it wasn't the greatest. The service was wonderful, but the drinks and food were not. The goat cheese was amazing, but the chickpeas were nothing to write home about. We did come here for dinner post-ownership shift and were really impressed. I haven't been here more than those couple of times, but I can see the 3 stars turning into 5. I got the mac and cheese and it was absolutely amazing. White cheddar, gorgonzola, chorizo, apple, and onion...I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I can't wait to come back and hopefully try something else, though I know that I'll probably get the mac and cheese again. What is holding me back from the 5 stars the mac and cheese deserves? Our dinner service was weird. Our server was nice, but we felt a little neglected. And the layout of the place, while interesting, doesn't lend itself to a really great experience in the winter. The seating area in the ""porch"" area was cold and felt really disconnected, though I'm not sure I would have enjoyed eating in the other cramped space we saw. I guess I just need to come back and get a better feel for the place.",3-star,negative

This was my first time eating at Felice on Saturday night (May 3rd) My date and I stopped in for the Reverse Happy Hour and sat at the bar upstairs. We both ordered appetizers and drinks. My appetizer was fine but one of the two appetizers my date ordered was less than appealing. He voiced his dissatisfaction and all our bartender could say was ""Sorry about that!"" No effort to correct the situation. I ordered a glass of Merlot and he informed me that they were out of Merlot but had a Cabernet available. I declined and asked him specifically, ""What white wines are available on the Happy Hour Menu?"" He named several including a Riesling which is what I chose. Happy Hour wines were $6. When the bill came, my glass of Riesling was $9! I brought this to his attention as he had named the Riesling as a Happy Hour wine choice and all he could tell me is, ""Oh, I misunderstood you, sorry there is nothing that I can do about that!"" Really? I think the question was quite clear. Felice just lost two customers and we will definitely let our friends and family know about our terrible experience here.

My favorites are the chicken wings, fried calamari, crispy chick peas, and barbecue ribs. The burger is good if you want something more filling. But I've tried pretty much everything on the happy hour menu and liked it. The cocktails here are delicious, not too sweet. Off their regular menu I like the steak and frites and their tacos. Their $22 3-course meal on Wednesdays is an awesome deal and I highly recommend it! Their molten chocolate cake is to die for (apple cobbler also delicious). Besides the food, I love the ambiance here. The outside patio is a must on warm summer nights. Open air, plenty of seats, and a covered area if its raining. They also opened a new bar/lounge area upstairs that's a nice place to hangout during happy hour or to grab drinks.

We went on the 3 for $22 night. We ordered a drink and our food. the appetizer came and then we waited an hour for our entrees. We mentioned the wait several times to the bartender and the response was simply....sorry we have a larger party inside and it is slowing down the kitchen. Not a great excuse in my opinion. By the time we were done with our entree it was almost 10pm so we got the dessert to go. At no time did the manager apologize or say a word to us. The second time, I was part of a party of 8. The service was slow again and it took over an hour for our entrees. Which I would forgive since it was a large party, but one of guest at our table mentioned the wait to the server. She proceeded to get the manager who came back and said we were wrong we did not wait an hour for our food. He knew this because he check the food ticket. This was not the response I was expecting. A simple apology would have gone a long way, but arguing with the guest is not the best way to gain a following. Plus, since the ticket was only put in 30 minutes prior to our food arriving and we did wait an hour, this means the server did not get our order in as soon as she took it. Then when I did take a bite of my burger, which I ordered rare, it was well done and cold. I was not impressed and will not go back.",1-star,negative

The happy hour is served on the top two floors on low tables and lounge-type seating so it can get a little awkward for eating, but I suppose the happy hour deals are worth it. The seafood taco was highly recommended but I would say it was good at best, not great. The poached mussels and steamed clams were very good. The goat cheese was very good and deliciously indulgent for a cheese lover such as myself. The service is great and I'd love to come here for a meal and not happy hour sometime!",4-star,positive

On to the food, the only item that was good was the goat cheese app. (kinda hard to screw up a cheese plate) the burger was greasy and about half the size of the bun. The frites were half cooked and dripping with grease.

Regardless, my girlfriend lives down the street and it is (in my opinion) the best place to hang out in the Shaker Square area. In the summer, the outdoor bar is awesome, and makes for a nice evening outside. The food is great, if you order the right things. I recommend piling up on the small plates and doing it during happy hour. They have a reverse happy hour that starts at 10pm and ends at 1am...yum.

The waiter forgot our drinks on numerous occasions and had to come back to clarify. I ordered the burger medium rare and it came out far past well done. Upon asking them to recook it (I rarely do this), it was just as overcooked. As a peace offering, they kindly offered to buy me a drink.

Knowing it was going to be a ""hip"" place (all the cool places have one word names right?) and seeing the gigantic rainclouds overhead, we took our chances. I walk in and immediately I'm lovin' it. Remember that this place used to be a pretty mediocre convenient store, but it has been transformed into a really one-of-a-kind coffee bar. I'm saying coffee bar because there's an actual bar surrounding the drink creation area. I was giggling the whole time at the ""fuel"" theme, which reminds me of a gas station 99 cent coffee blend (cough cough Sheetz). I ordered the iced fuel, while my friends got the fuel of the day. My friends enjoyed their hot fuel while I was delightfully surprised at how smooth the iced fuel was. Here's the dealbreaker, folks. When you go into other little independently owned coffee shops, there's usually half-n-half, sugar, Splenda, stirrers, and that's just about it. NOT HERE. CONDIMENTS GALORE. You can add syrups FOR FREE in your beverage, choose from 5 different sweeteners....or even more(?), add half-and-half or whole milk, and powder up your beverage to perfection with chocolate or cinnamon. Having a myriad of add-ins allows for my beverage to be ~perfect~. The seating area is very intimate and cozy. The bar seats up to 3 people and the shop seats about 10, which is really neat when you want to clamp down and read a book, but can be a huge bummer when there is open mic night. That being said, we visited Fuel during a high schooler's ""my first open mic"" experience, where she played covers of awful mid 2000s soft rock songs. New Shoes by Paolo Nutini and You're Beautiful by James Blunt anyone? No thank you. We were stuck in this odd situation similar to a coffee shop purgatory, where some of us sat down 5 feet away from her, and others stood from afar. There came a point where we all realized that we much rather sit outside in the light rain at this point than handle another 20 minutes of acoustic covers. In short, excellent coffee, really relaxed and comfy atmosphere, just avoid open mic nights if you want to converse with your friends.",4-star,positive

It was a beautiful night and we really wanted to sit outside and relax with a cup of coffee. What we soon realized is that there really isn't a coffee shop in Little Italy. Corbos and Presti serve coffee, but it's more of a side venture for them. They also close fairly early. So quite by accident we came across a large patio with all kinds of tables and chairs all with a small bunch of fresh flowers on them and a really good guitarist in the corner. We soon realized that we had stumbled across a gem. The owner was friendly and gracious, the menu was small but covered all of the basic coffee drinks, and the atmosphere was as charming as you could want.The coffee was fresh, hot, and delicious. We felt like we were in New York City at one of the many little cafes that line the sidewalks there. BONUS.....They own six parking spaces on the side of the building. If you spend any time at all in Little Italy you know how essential that is. The addition of a few small plates would make this my go to coffe shop in the area. Best of luck to them. This is a business I will go back to over and over again.",5-star,positive
913,cafes_list,"I went to Fuel for the first time yesterday, and I just loved the feel of the place... the warm/cozy decor, the super friendly staff, the good music... I actually stopped by later that same day to re-Fuel (....haha). As for the coffee, in the afternoon I tried their International/World Coffee of the Day, and later that evening I had an iced soy latte. Also tried two of their five biscotti varieties, a chocolate cherry and a cranberry pistachio. Everything was tasty and reasonably priced! The outdoor patio is a nice place to hangout, and open mic night on Wednesday was a lot of fun! (They've got a pretty nice ""house"" acoustic-electric guitar if you don't bring your own.) I'll definitely be going back to try more coffee varieties and desserts!",5-star,positive
914,cafes_list,"So, on one of my exercise walks, I was coming down the hill through Little Italy and I found that the location of a former convenience store had now become Fuel Coffee Bar. I was pleased:) Fuel has the feeling of an outdoor cafe combined with the warmth of a little corner bistro. The menu which includes (SURPRISE!) Coffee, espresso, organic sweet treats and even dessert fondue, is nice and not terribly pricey. The ambiance is intimate, warm and a nice place to stop for a post-dinner treat if you're heading out from the many restaurants in Little Italy, or, if you're a student, a nice place to stop for a study session and a nosh with friends. Some of the minor drawbacks are that there's only street parking (which goes for most ALL of Little Italy), and that I wasn't sure if they had wifi, but really, it's a wonderful place to stop for a snack and a pick-me-up. So, if you need to recharge, stop off and get some fuel...at Fuel:)",4-star,positive

923,cafes_list,I'm a frequent visitor of greens and proteins just because they list their macros and it's good on the go. However today I went to dine in since I had extra time on my hands. I get there around 1:00-1:30 pm and it seems as they just cooled down from lunch hour. Anyways so I order a chicken teriyaki sandwich with cheese and grilled onions added. I usually pay around 13$ for this. This time they charged me almost 15$ I was shocked but I rolled with it and requested the receipt. Later when I looked at the receipt I saw they charged me $2.00 for some grilled onions rather than the usually $0.50. So I'm sure it was a mistake so I take it up to the cashier and she fixes the issue for me and refunds me the difference. So here I am now waiting on my food for almost twenty minutes which also wasn't a big deal because I wasn't in a rush. However once I receive my food it's just disappointment. I got a cold chicken sandwich with no cheese and no grilled onions. (What I paid extra for) and to top it off my sweet potato fries were cold and barely edible. Overall it was an upsetting meal.,1-star,negative

I love breakfast foods so my fave go-to is the tomato mozzarella frittata (which comes with this amazing watermelon salad!!!) Be wary of all the gym rats that frequent this place....G&P's are very conveniently located next to a LVAC gym, and you can definitely tell they attract that clientele ;) This particular location is is probably my fave (been to the one on Flamingo which isn't as warm or bright) and while neon green isn't my favorite color, the restaurant is overall very clean and modern.",4-star,positive

Your food is ready and usually less than five minutes and it's hot and delicious. If you're looking for someplace that's not deep-fried and not slathered in sauces, come here you won't be disappointed. The reason for the four stars instead of the five is that I think their dining area could use a little bit more revamping. The ambience is fine but the chairs and tables are kind of cheap and flimsy.

939,cafes_list,"Not organic enough, not gluten free enough. A tiny bit vegan friendly as long as you eat any old vegetables, and most vegans don't. We pay attention. My regular cities where I dining are NYC and LA so by comparison it may have led to me be harsh with only two stars because for vegas this place might be a three or four star but for overall healthy food restaurants coast to coast it is a solid 2 star. My preferred combo of gluten free and vegan was too much for this place. That's normal. So, Conscious eaters need not apply. I was drawn in by the name because it sounded like something on Abbot Kinney - the hippest spot in Venice, CA. It's not truly a healthy food restaurant if you're actually into ACTUAL health food. If you're in transition from Chili's, Subway, TGIF's etc then this is a great stepping stone to Whole Foods or the vegan menu at the Wynn. The young guy behind the counter was not interested in my questions to determine what I could eat that had no eggs and no gluten. The answer ""Not sure"" when I ask if something has eggs or gluten is a bit of a lame response. The answer to what I could eat there was nothing so it didn't really matter anyways after all. My friend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza for takeout and devoured it, but since he regularly eats at Jack in the Box and McDonald's taking his word for quality food feedback is hardly realistic. In fact, his diet was so foul we had to cut way back on the hanging out. TMI. Still, people who go here seem to be enjoying it and the smoothie though not organic, that I took one tiny sip of, was pretty good. If you're not crazy picky about what you eat you'll love it and if you're a food snob keep driving.",2-star,negative

943,cafes_list,"OMG... I was in food heaven! :) My friend and I decided to give this place a try because we were hearing such good things about it and about their vegan options. So this what we ordered and shared: 1st dish: Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito...oh man, this was awesome. The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty. I'm sure that any non-vegan would have never guessed that this was a vegan dish... it was that good. The chorizo was da bomb! The dish even came with tofu nuggets, which was amazing too. They really need to add tofu nuggets as an appetizer. I could eat that all day... just pop it in my mouth. 2nd dish: Granola toasted french toast... ok i must admit, that it wasn't vegan because of the type of whole wheat bread that they used.. but it was all good with me cuz they didn't use egg to coat the granola to the bread.... so i just decided to try it. It was delish!!! The granola was mixed in with nuts, and raisins...mmm, mmm, mmm. I felt like my breakfast turned into a dessert, but at the same time, it just tasted healthy. :) this place is like halfway between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant... but to my surprise the dishes were visual appearing. They took time to make it look pretty and presentable. I was so hungry and the food looked so good, that I didn't take any pictures of my food. I also think that the dishes are reasonably priced. We paid less than $20 for both dishes....I love paying $20 or less for 2 people when I go out to eat. Hey, when the food is good and the price is right, then that's an awesome deal. I will go back for sure and order more off the vegan menu and try to take pics of it before I feed my face. I recommend you try this place out and your taste buds will say thank you.",5-star,positive
944,cafes_list,"Best smoothies in Las Vegas, - whether you are vegan or not, these are unvelivable and very healthy, and not loaded with disguised names for sugars like turbinado, cane sugar, etc. Although they do have honey and /or agave in them so you can ask for that to be omitted, you wont miss it. I love their green shake and their chocolate peanut butter banana shake personally. They sneak in things like zucchini, and kale, and other very healthy foods and i swear you do not taste them! Although i have gone there many times for the smoothies i will admit I have eaten there only twice, neither was memorable for the price, i give them credit for making a difference to give people healthy options, but for example ...the tofu fries are not healthy, they are just deep fried tofu sticks The daiya cheese based vegetarian pizza is good compared to some places versions of it, but the only way to make it truly vegan(unless you want it served on a raw cracker) is to get it on the gluten free crust, after you substitute the crust you are getting charged 14.99, otherwise if you dont mind the raw crust its 11.99 -in my opinion it is rather small and can be inhaled in just a few bites, i say its 8 inches at most and very thin. Not a great value -If you do the ""build your own custom meal"" they let you pick 1 protein, 1 vegetable, and 1 grains, not a great value, the plate is very very small.. although healthy tasting and not oily to try to make it taste better. but by the time you lunch and the smoothie you are looking at 20.00 minimum and you wont be full after. Another issue i find is it can be very busy at lunch time, and they only ever have 1 person working the cash register, the line up can go out the door and the seats are all taken during these rushes., combine that with people asking questions about the menu and being indecisive (me included)I think they should get at least 1 more register to get things running more smooth.",4-star,positive

I assumed we were going to munch sugary lettuce, force down processed fake meats and cheeses and maybe power through weird dense bread. Being in this mindset, Greens and Proteins was a pleasant surprise. Nicely decorated yet still casual. Warning: watering system for the wall plants make a startling sound. Parking is a piece of cake. It's in the same plaza as the athletic club and starbucks. The ordering system is like Jason's Deli. Order/pay then they give you a number. Then they bring your food to you. They bus the tables too so don't awkwardly stand holding your refuse while darting your eyes around like I did. I ordered a small caesar salad. It was huge. I couldn't finish it. It was standard taste. Also had a green ginger limeade. It was a whopping $5.99. It was dense, flavorful, refreshing and pleasant. But the thing I have to come back for are the ""tofu fries."" They were thick, fried strips of tofu. Not caked in batter. Not oily. Just dusted in spice. The only downsides were weird meathead customers and it's a little expensive. You should try it!",4-star,positive
948,cafes_list,"One aspect I really enjoy about restaurants is when they are immaculately clean. Everything was spotless and organized. There are plenty of seats outside the patio if the weather is nice, & inside it's very spacious, with trendy tables, a nice wall backdrop with running water, & several televisions. Service is alright. Nothing going beyond the means of customer service & nothing that's bad either. If you are anyone who is a raw foodie, don't expect this place to state it uses USDA Organic certified items just because it's named 'Greens and Proteins' (that's a question I'm going to ask the next time I'm in!) The menu is definitely a little more healthier than your fast-food alternatives, with wraps, pizza, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, juices, the works. The pricing was what got me, since I could get a green smoothie at Whole Foods for about .50 cents less than here (one that is a lot less sweeter). I purchased the vegetable wrap & the green smoothie, all of which came out to $20 (definitely not cheap, as most health-alternative restaurants aren't). I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the green smoothie turned out! While $7.50 is a little much, at the same time it was in a cup that was generous in size for its price. It was very sweet (from the agave nectar & stevia), nothing like the green smoothies from Whole Foods which are a little more on the less sweeter end. I was even more impressed by the vegetable wrap, for it was a filling size (had to take the other portion to-go) & it came with these tofu-like fries with seasoning & a dip sauce on the side that was amazing! Walking in, I was a little questionable about this place, even more so by the price, but after tasting it for myself, it's actually quite good here. I debated giving it three stars, but I was reminded by my green smoothie it's definitely a place I'd like to return to when I'm in the neighborhood craving a healthy alternative to other restaurants surrounding them!",4-star,positive

951,cafes_list,"Arrived here on a Saturday night at 8pm for our dinner reservation. The place was empty but it seemed to fill up over the next 15 minutes. The server brought everyone to attention and asked that we do NOT look at the food menu. He insisted that it would be best to NOT look at the menu because ""of the way it works"" it can be very confusing. He recommended that HE order for us based on our dietary restrictions and tastes. (Sidenote: this is a tapas bar. Everyone is aware that the plates are to share. There are 8-10 small dishes and 3-4 larger dishes on the menu. It was not complicated). After this, he came by our table to take our drink order. Shortly after, our drinks arrived but he had gotten the order wrong (we were three people). He came back with the correct drink and asked us what we would like to eat. As per his instruction, we did not look at the menu...long story short, he said that if we let him order for us, he would be conservative in his order and we would not be looking at a huge bill of $300. He recommended a few dishes and from that, we gathered we should just order for ourselves. We ordered 5 tapas dishes,1 main and 1 dessert. Warning: if you are hungry, do not come here. The food is literally ONE bite and each plate is designed for 2 people to share. He adjusted the plates to accommodate 3 people but of course, charged 1.5X the price. This restaurant is extremely overpriced for the portions and design. I've eaten at some wonderful restaurants that are meant to serve food designed to evoke different tastes and senses ... this is not one of them. The server actually went on to tell us how ""the chicken is not working these days"". Cesar came by towards the end of our meal to welcome us. He asked if we had tried the olives and we said that we hadn't because we had decided against it. He insisted that we try the olives and ""not to worry"". We assumed that meant he was treating us to some olives because it was something he was proud to serve. The olives never made it to our table and our bill came shortly after that interaction... with olives included in the price. Including a 15% tip (honestly, this was generous at this point - the server was EXTREMELY chatty and over-complicated the experience) it came to $97 each. We paid roughly $15 for each bite of food. All was not lost, the new bartender made DELICIOUS cocktails. He was the highlight of the evening.",1-star,negative
952,cafes_list,"Dinner at Hola this evening was a fiasco that left us laughing about the completely amateurish attempt at haute-cuisine tapas. We could not leave fast enough! I have had better service in the food court of a shopping mall. It left us really wondered if the staff (who were all very friendly) were trying to be bad on purpose. A short list of transgressions include (1) Our drinks came 20 minutes after ordering. The waiter told us the cachaça based drink I had ordered was ""extremely complex"". To add insult to injury the waitress tried to take our drinks away before we had finished....I know the place is dimly lit but come on did you ask if we were done??? How oblivious can you be!!!!! (2) Three staff came to out table in the 40 minutes before one finally asked about our dinner order, (3) The waiter only noticed we had no utensils after our second course was served (we ate the first course with our fingers), (4) we requested water three times before finally being served a glass each with our final courses, and (5) the last two (from a total of five) tapas plates came to us well over 30 minutes after the prior plate. There were fifteen patrons and three staff (including the owner) out front so there are no excuses for such poor service. If you are going to charge high prices and are attempting to pitch yourself as a fine dining restaurant you should at the very least ensure the level of service customers receive is professional. In summary the food was creative but mediocre, prices were shamelessly expensive and service was clumsy and inattentive. Hola is like a parody of what fine dining should be.",1-star,negative
953,cafes_list,"I really had no idea what to expect when I booked Hola Cafe. I had made same-day plans to meet a friend for dinner and did a quick look online for places in Leslieville with high ratings, and the first restaurant to pop up was Hola Cafe. (Note that the menu has changed recently so this review is based on what I understand is a more upscale menu compared to their earlier menu that included things like empanadas and other ""snacks""). To start, Cesar, the owner, called me to confirm the reservation that afternoon and checked on any food allergies. I thought it was a nice touch that he was the one to call and also that he introduced himself, so when I walked in, I felt like we were already old friends and Cesar was there to greet me when I arrived. We started with yummy pisco sours, a nice memory for me of time I've spent in Peru and Ecuador. Both Cesar and our server gave us recommendations for our meal and we shared 5 small dishes plus the steak. Each dish involved elaborate preparation based on science. I found the process very interesting but probably what matters here is to say that every bite was outstanding. The olives, which are not exactly olives but rather made of olives, were such a delightful surprise. The prosciutto-wrapped dates were a wonderful combination of sweet and savory and the artichokes with brie were delicious but my favourite dish overall was the chicken boccadillo, which actually uses perfectly crisp chicken skin as the ""bread"". I was so distracted by how delicious it was, I can't remember everything Cesar told me about it but I'm salivating thing about it! My friend also had the crab cakes which she said were fantastic. This might sound like a lot of food but it's not like the tapas you've had in Basque bars in Barcelona; chunks of bread with little morsels of food on top of them. Each tapas plate came with 2 or 3 bite-sized items, so along with a the steak that we shared (which was also perfectly done), we had just enough to eat. I don't often order dessert but my friend ordered the creme brulé, which was more of a whip with broken up pieces of sugary crust. Of course, I had a taste and it was light and fluffy and delightful. A note about the wine. There were a handful of wines available by the glass and these were all reasonably priced, for example, the Tempranillo was only $10 a glass. PS - Don't let the signage dissuade you. This restaurant will give you one of the most interesting dining experiences at a reasonable price.",5-star,positive

The atmosphere is casual and cozy with a grouping of small tables and a large red tile top bar, where we chose to sit and watch the chef at work. In reading some of the reviews on Yelp about portion size, a reminder, this is a tapas bar or small plates. It is not about size but about flavor. The small plates presented by Chef Casar were nothing short of pure genius, making Hola Cafe a rare gem worthy of this 5 star rating. Casar has managed to elevate traditional tapas with his own take using molecular gastronomy and a few other techniques to enhance and coax incredible flavors and textures from his ingredients. We started the meal with ""Olivas"", olives which has been pureed and then reconstituted to take their original shape served on a spoon with a touch of olive oil and a hint of rosemary. ($12). Casar encourages you to eat them as you would an oyster. The flavor and oil was subtle and a most remarkable start to the meal. The Croquetas de Bacalao ($10) were small fried balls of heaven filled with cod sofrito and accompanying red pepper aioli. Crunchy on the outside and packed with layers of flavor on the inside. These were perfectly fried and not at all greasy. The Queso Frito ($10) was unlike any other I have had. Beautifully sculpted and layered on the plate was a seared Haloumi cheese, a touch of ratatouille and topped with an olive tapenade, all accompanied by small fried onions for texture. Perhaps my favorite of the night was Bombones De Alcachofa. ($10) These were literally small bonbons of artichoke served on top of a whipped brie cheese ""salsa"" and topped with a truffle caviar. Each flavor was distinct, subtle and yet melded in a way to present a cohesive dish like no other. Truly exceptional. Other highlights of the evening were ... warmed prosciutto wrapped around a date ($9) with a catelope gel puree with black peppercorn which presented a perfect balance of sweet and savory in one bite; a live rose filled with a gel of rosewater and honey in which smell and taste were intertwined for a sensory delight; and a reconstructed capresa with house dehydrated tomatoes, burata cheese and fresh basil ($14). Chef Casar explained that he could not find tomatoes with the flavor desired, but by using a dehydrator he was more than able to restore the intensity of flavor one looks for in a capresa. Topping off the evening for a desert was Espuma De Crema Catalana ($14), a whipped cream or infused milk foam with orange and lime zest and cookie crumble with a hint of cinnamon. This was seriously so light and delicate and o so good! The sign of a good meal is when the flavors still resonate on your palate long after the meal has concluded. My visit to Hola Cafe was one of the better meals I have had in Toronto and I will be back for more!",5-star,positive
955,cafes_list,"Mrs. Pinky and I kind-of-sort-of ended up here by accident. As tourists in Toronto we were off the beaten path, but it was a glorious mistake. Caesar, the proprietor, was behind the bar. He took care of us. I had a couple of the best cocktails I've ever had --- seriously well crafted mojitos and caipirinhas -- and the food was OK. I wouldn't say it was 5 star food, but we had, without a doubt, a 5 star experience. I plan to return the next time I am in Toronto and would recommend anyone in the neighborhood to check out Caesar's place.",5-star,positive
956,cafes_list,"My wife and I wandered in here one night really wanting to like it mainly because we live near by and there aren't any lounge-y cocktail bars. Based on the hight *'s we thought this would be a gem. Like other reviews mentioned, the owner is super friendly and welcoming. That's all the good I can say about this place. We ordered a couple of food items, most notably the potato bravas. It was about half a potato cubed and tasted like it was tossed in BBQ powder. All the portions are really tiny for the price and was nothing mind blowing taste wise. The cocktails were also mediocre. When we received our drinks, my wife found her's a bit watery but didn't say anything. The bartender came by, asked her how her drink was and she just said it's ok. He kept pushing her for her true opinion until she finally said that it's actually quite watery. Surprisingly he started defending the watery drink saying it's because the restaurant doesn't have a proper ice machine and they only had bagged ice. We were left wondering why he was prodding so hard if he did not intend to comp. the drink, or remake it. It was quite strange. So we left there a bit baffled at the pricing, the drinks situation and also all the 5 star reviews. Over all, the owner is super friendly, the restaurant has cool vibe for just hanging out but is very overpriced for what you get. Another note, the yelp $$ system is misleading in this case because while each item on the menu is in that price range, the portions are miniscule. The food quantity and quality to dollars paid ratio is extremely low.",2-star,negative

The two us split the BBQ Chorizo sausages, fried queso, fish tacos and quesadillas which were all incredible, although I think I liked the quesdillas best.

There are comfortable sofas along the side side walls to have a a comfortable evening and nice conversations with friends etc. the food was quite good I enjoyed how it was tapas style. House wine for 5 dollars a glass is a great deal especially since it was a very nice flavour. The owner is very welcoming and conversational. He is very friendly and checkdd in on us regularly recommending other items and making sure we Were enjoying our food and drinks. I had the beef empanadas which has great flavour and the cheese platter for dessert was a great assortment of all cheeses and styles to please every palate.

We decided to take the house wine and for there were no other guests except of us we became a free upgrade to the best Chardonnay he had. While choosing the tapas we get some tips which would taste the best, but we didn't take them at all. Even though the four tapas we take where also great. They tasted very aromatic and were enough for the two of us. This bar is a very good alternative, if you like something more than pizza or burger.",5-star,positive
963,cafes_list,"Atmosphere is everything. This place instantly transports you from the tranquil hip streets of Leslieville into the vibrancy of South America. The bright colour palate on the interior is in sharp contrast to the ignorable walk-by exterior. Perhaps that's the thing that makes it so great. It's like a hidden secret that once you find you want to tell everyone about. It's something that you can't get elsewhere. Truly unique drinks. Warm conversation. Smiling faces. Even though it's Venezuelan in heritage, you can't help but feel like you've stumbled into a hip spot in Palermo Soho in Buenos Aires. They've got what appears to be an awesome schedule of tasting events. And what appears to be a great menu with some cool multicultural variations on the tapas theme. But all I know is that the chocolate old fashioned is to die for.",5-star,positive
964,cafes_list,"I walked into Hola and instantly felt an atmosphere that I have not experienced in a big city. I come from a small town and Cesar and Hugo made me feel like I was home again. They greeted us with smiles and instantly made us feel welcome. We ordered a variety of Tapas which were all superb. Cesar asked us which one was our favourite and I could not decide; maybe the pork sausage. The main course was zucchini pasta with tomato sauce which was delicious. Cesar paid attention to details and asked me how I liked my sauce. We had a chocolate orange cake which was to die for. The icing on the cake of our evening. I was celebrating that night, and he made the evening extra special for us. The music they bring in is one of a kind. It is what I call ""real talent"" that brings me back wanting more. Everyone is auto tuned these days and the individuals they bring in are the real thing that you will see nowhere else. The staff does their best to bring the whole experience to you. Everyone should take the time to check this place out. You will not regret it. It is a home away from home and you will be remembered.",5-star,positive
965,cafes_list,Friendly but seemed a bit disorganized. Perhaps new staff on weekends?. Ordered carrot muffin with my espresso (to go) and they weren't really sure how to give it to me. No bag. Just put on a napkin. I will try again to see how it goes- as espresso blend was good!,4-star,positive

974,cafes_list,"Being the only business around the Hoover Dam, this place was super busy. My boyfriend and I were super hungry from not eating breakfast and heading straight to the dam, so we decided to grab a bite to eat. The food is very overpriced as expected, being in a touristy area like this. Our food was okay. We ordered the chicken strips that came with a side of fries, and we ordered an extra side of fries; the total came out to be almost $20. The fries were just cheap frozen bags of fries that anyone can get at a grocery store. The chicken was very thin like the took a meat tenderizer and smashed the heck out of it. The inside of the cafe was crowded, but there was seating outside with umbrellas so it wasn't bad. The cashier that took our food order was nice too. The menu was next to her register, and they have stickers covering up the old prices. All the pictures on here of the menu had old prices. Once we were at the cafe, we saw that everything was about a dollar more.",2-star,negative

Greasy, burnt, thin unflavored meat with chunks of peppers, an onion or two, very little cheese, no mayo or ketchup. I took a small bite of the meat and it was totally disgusting, my husband took a bite and his face told it all...it took us a few minutes of eating other stuff to get the burnt taste out of our mouth.

Halfway through our trip, instead of going to the Grand Canyon we decided to drive 40 minutes to go to the Hoover Dam (I didn't see Clark Griswold climbing on it). The place has got like a High School Cafeteria feeling to it, we just order our Food, they give us a Number then when the Food is ready. After picking out Souvenirs for the Family we decided to get a bite to eat. I got the Dam Dog (this thing was freakin Big), It was 1/2 Pound Weenie made from Beef & Pork. I ate it with no condiments whatsoever, with every bite I took those juices kept dripping down my Chin. It was so big I couldn't finish it (maybe I shouldn't have eaten those Fries). It was a Valiant effort and a Dam good one at that. Nathan got a Quesadilla with Rice and Refried Beans (Nathan enjoyed the Quesadilla very well, picked it up like a Sandwich and ate it in just a few Bites, he said that the Rice was ok, One Dimensional in Flavor. He said there was no way that he was gonna touch those Refried Beans, says they'll mess up his Stomach). Its not a 5 Star Gourmet Restaurant (far from it) its got that Greasy Spoon feel to it.

Peach, strawberry, and taro. The only one that didn't look crappy was the taro but unfortunately the flavor was way off. Take a look at the picture I added. All the syrup went to the bottom and it we like a little bit of ice on top. So weird. I've never had anything like this before and fingers crossed, I won't again.

Oddly located in the back of a strip mall, hidden away from the street by a popular chain dessert shop, which probably explains why the shop was so empty on a Saturday evening. My friend and I ordered the pineapple lychee snow ice as well as a mango sensation snow ice to share. The desserts were gorgeous and well-presented in a martini glass. Unfortunately, looks were indeed deceiving. Pretty, but the flavors were lacking for both of the dishes. I preferred the pineapple lychee to the mango but they both had an unappealing artificial flavor I didn't care for. Neither my friend nor I felt the need to finish either dish.

On top of that, I got to use the 15% off discount on our entire purchase which was great! Who doesn't love a great discount? Definitely gonna try out other snacks next time because they looked so good!

She was very patient. Explained the menu and what they had, was enthusiastic. It was good enough for me to want to take my husband and try it, Not to long after, my husband and I went. When we went to the counter, the short Asian girl took our order and her voice was faint. I could barely hear her. Plus, there was no greeting, no service with a smile, or anything. We ordered a large lemon tea with boba, large jasmine tea sweetened with no boba & a snow dessert, & some water. Good thing I kept my receipt! Firstly, when the guy came out with our drinks, they were both small & my drink was creamy, like it had milk in it. I didn't ask for jasmine milk tea. & my tea had boba. I gave it back to them. They came back and my drink was still had boba and was not sweetened. Whatevers, I gave up. There was no point of them fixing the lemon tea either. My husband drank it & his words were ""uhg."" He didn't like it at all. +Our snow dessert was disappointing. My husbands exact words were, ""it's different"" but not in the best way. Btw, i DID order water and it took quite some time to come out. I felt awful taking him here when we could've went somewhere else.

I quickly looked it up and decided to go, even though the reviews are pretty mixed. Parking was super easy. Their doors are waaaay to heavy and close a little too fast, kinda dangerous. I was personally looking forward to some desserts or pastries that I saw on here. Their case was full! 3 shelves!!! I can't even explain all the great options! Red Raspberry Macaron or almond cookie. WHAAAAAT?!?! The cashier offered us a menu and we decided on coffee snow fluff and vanilla honey toast. She asked which size snow fluff and I decided large. She let me know it would be 10-15 minutes for the toast and they were out of vanilla ice cream and using vanilla snow fluff instead. I sat down with the kids and started playing jenga. After a short while she brought out our snow fluff, small size. I reminded her i ordered large so she made us the large and let us keep the small. As far as the fluff it was tasty, till you got below the syrup topping. It's as if the snow had little to no flavor but they made up for it by using some kind of syrup then condensed milk. The panna cotta was surprisingly delish, I almost ordered more! The coffee jelly was good, not too solid. After a while our toast came out and besides the snow fluff they subbed for vanilla ice cream it was good. I sorta spent my entire visit thinking of things I would do to make that place killer. There aren't too many boba places in our area. The concept is great, the restaurant is very nicely decorate, and the menu is doable! I think they need to focus on their flavors, use all natural ingredients, and train their employees a little better.

1000,cafes_list,"I wasnt particularly fond of ice monster cafe. Their interior is pretty nice and comfortable but for quality drinks and snow ice I wasnt impressed. Prices for a small flavored ice was $5 which is served in a very tiny martini glass, large is about $10. I ordered the taro slush sensation, and a friend of mine got the thai tea, green tea float, and mango slush sensation. The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day. The workers were pretty nice but not very helpful or knowledgeable at all on their products, it was more like ordering from a vending machine with no personality or presence unfortunately. I dont think I will ever be back but if I do return, maybe next visit will be better.",1-star,negative

1005,cafes_list,"The desserts here are absolutely great! Yes, few--very, very few--may not be to my liking, as in the taro snow fluff, (red beans are a little too sweet for my taste), but you can't always expect to love everything anywhere. Anyway, I've gone here more times than I should've the past month, but each time that I have the staff & owner are always so friendly and extremely generous. I always feel so welcomed whenever they remember my face! Not only is service fantastic but, as mentioned before, the desserts are absolutely yummy! Lol. My favorite snow fluff is the honeydew--which, by the way isn't on the menu yet ;) --and I love to get it with strawberry ice cream! Lol. Eating here is a great way to cool down, especially with summer about to kick us in the face, hahaha. And with their large-sized portions, there's no way anyone could ever stay hot in this weather. I'd say you get what you pay for, and sometimes more! Also, this place is a chill spot to hang out. They have a few games on their shelves you can play while eating up your desserts. So not only do you get to enjoy your food but you get to have a fun time while eating as well! :) This place is seriously my new favorite spot to hit at night, especially since they're open 'til 1am, (YAAAAAS!

1006,cafes_list,"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(160/365) ""Total Monstrosity"" Dear Ice Monster, We came with very high hopes and a lot of excitement that you've been in the neighborhood for two weeks now.Brand spankin' new, video screen of all your beautiful treats, nice display case showing off your pastries, desserts and sandwiches, view window of the kitchen where all the magic supposedly happens, and very comfy seating and games to play while we enjoy our drinks and desserts...WOW! That wow factory snowballed for the worst as soon as we placed our orders. Your two servers looked very professional and seemed ready to bust out the orders like no ones business. I don't think they were ready when the Yelperazzi rolled in. Wifey ordered the UGI Milk Foam Tea, and out of curiosity I asked what UGI was. His answer? ""Um, That's what we're(you mean you!?) trying to figure out..I think its a kind of tea leaf. I can try and Google it?"" HUH? I also asked about their Honey Milk Tea, and he assured me it was delicious, and he had the nerve to confidently add on that they make their boba fresh everyday. Sold! We all sat around a huge table and were enjoying a few rounds of Jenga when I look up to see what the hold up is with our orders, it was chaos.Two servers trying to get the orders out and through the glass window, the man who I think created the Ice Monster Cafe standing behind the scenes watching his workers take the fall, and seemingly more interested to get back to the FIFA World Cup, but he couldn't return knowing that we were right next to him and didn't receive half of our orders yet! The five year old in our party gets a coffee drink instead of a tea that he ordered, Wifey's order was good, another drink was wrong and had to be fixed, my order came 20+ minutes later and was not a Honey Milk Tea like I had ordered but a Thai Tea and I drank it anyway, and the boba? The most al dente boba I've ever tasted. Not a very good first impression, but we wish you the best and hope you are able to work out the kinks...ALOHA!!!

1007,cafes_list,"As an avid lover of desserts and snow ice, I was ecstatic that this place opened on rainbow, so close to my boyfriend's house! As we walked in, the place was lively. Possibly because it is brand new. Awesome interior, but that's pretty much it. I was disappointed after getting all hyped up about this place. Their menu is quite confusing. Snow slush, snow yogurt slush, and etc. I didn't know how to depict the menu and when I asked, neither did the workers. I decided to get the strawberry snow ice (not my first choice, they didn't have the one I wanted ""that day""), which to my surprise, wasn't fluffy nor soft. It was just like regular shaved ice texture you get from one of those trucks or stands. I was expecting it to be soft and fluffy like kuma's snow ice since their machines look pretty much the same. It was really big, but that's no problem since it was almost a whopping $10 for it. It also came with a lot of strawberries. For me, it was too much. There were three of us there and we still couldn't finish it. I also got a strawberry smoothie with boba which was okay. The boba was hard, yuck. Not enjoyable. My boyfriend also got an apple pie. It was about $5 for a slice and he didn't finish that either. He said was ""okay"" and ""nothing special."" If it weren't for the interior and very nice decor, I would probably give it one star. But I feel like since they've just opened they have much more improving to do. Being over priced for an okay dessert isn't much to drool over. Looks like I'll be sticking to Kuma or Snowflake. But hopefully they will figure things out soon!",2-star,negative

The food was good, fish and chips was not overcooked. Really good tartar sauce. The patio is ADORABLE. Like if you're the person to just go somewhere for the aesthetics- go here. Sunflower print tablecloths, umbrellas, sting lights, fresh flowers on the table, a garden behind the dining area. The ambiance and the views plus the good food made me not care about the subpar service. Would definitely return.",4-star,positive
1014,cafes_list,"Why all the haters? The island cafe is not fine dining and you're not in a big city resto. Relax enjoy the slower pace (that's why you came to the island today isn't it?) and be thankful you don't need to rush to get back to work after you gobble down your quick lunch at your desk, like you did for the last five days. We stopped in after a day of biking on the island and had lunch. Reasonable food (club house and kids grilled cheese sandwiches with salad and fries) at reasonable prices. Given that there is virtually no competition the fact that you can sit on their patio and sip a cold lemonade for $2.25 was completely unexpected. Sure it was a bit slow getting the bill. The place was super busy and the waitstaff have to navigate some pretty narrow walkways between tables. Those 10 extra minutes waiting for the bill was just another 10 extra minutes enjoying the beautiful weather. I go there every time we go to the islands if not for a meal then for some of their awesome ice cream.",4-star,positive

We waited and for awhile and no one acknowledged us so we went and sat at the bar. Staff weirdly avoided eye contact and one was dancing to 90s rap. We smiled and waited patiently and were totally ignored. They were not busy and certainly saw us but 6 staff members ignored us. No ""we will be with you in a sec"" they just stood around talking to each other and ignored us. After about 10 minutes of this we left. Seems like a nice place, too bad the service sucks.

1018,cafes_list,"The cafe is in one of the most beautiful spots in Toronto. They are growing most all the greens they use right in their garden, any other produce from Ontario Food Terminal and meats from Sanigans. Great sangria and the Jimador is refreshing. Daily specials are the best - fried chicken, chicken dinners, pizzas, fish. Every thing is done in beauty and they make every effort for a light footprint and to improve the community and place that supports and sustains them. Free kale on Tuesday harvests from a pilot project with the city to see how many pounds of kale can be grown in a city park on 1/100th of an acre. 5-7pm I think. Just beautiful.

It's a homegrown garden in a little bathtub against a backdrop of floating boats. How can you get angry? So there seems to be a trend here that says the service is horrible. I don't know if the weekend staff is different from the weekday staff (went on a Thursday afternoon), but whaaaat? These guys were some of the nicest, most mellow people that I've ever come across in a restaurant. And this place was bustling (there was an event on the island). They forgot our items a couple times and we had to remind them, but each time, they had a great attitude about it. Everyone was very polite about any questions we had. The ice cream guy asked twice if there was anything he can get for me. Can't complain about the food either! Ordered a smoked fish board expecting the regular slices of grocery store smoked salmon. It came out as a beautiful filet on a bed of homegrown kale and pickled onions. The only thing that made it better was my iced latte, which was deliciously creamy. They even have a finishing station with all types of sugar (simple syrup and honey included) and milk, perfect for any drink. Honestly, this was a perfect island escape across from a city that is riddled with transit troubles and housing headaches. My advice? Take your date here. Too bad this place is so far from me, but I'm willing to keep up this long-distance relationship. Wait for me, Island Cafe, I'll be back to to sip coffee by the lake and eat your freshly grown veggies soon. (60/100) - 2016",5-star,positive
1020,cafes_list,"My experience here was terrible from start to finish. First, the host (who also ended up being our server) needs a major attitude check. She acted exasperated when we asked simple things like where the bathroom was located, etc. They were out of literally all alcohol listed on their menu except what they were calling a ""margarita."" Every surface I touched seemed to be sticky. The nachos my mom ordered looked like Tostitos scoop chips with sprinkle cheese that was nuked in the microwave...for $15.

We ordered a variety of things from the menu including eggs benedict, tofu scramble and a sandwich. I had the benny and it was as bland as can be. A barely toasted english muffin with some avocado and tasteless hollandaise served with about 10 cubes of potatoes that were insufficiently cooked. My partner had the tofu scramble and it was also bland - no flavour whatsoever. The server was pretty good - he was friendly but clearly had too many tables since he was being flagged down by everyone for things like ketchup and drinks. The food came decently quickly. It's just a shame that it sucked. We chose this place over the Rectory which is more expensive but I'd be happy to pay extra for palatable food. I'll be giving this place another shot later in the season, but if it's similar to this experience I'll be relying on the Rectory from then on.",2-star,negative

She rolled her eyes and said ""yeah"". When I asked for the menu, she motioned behind her to a messy chalkboard sign and said ""um, it's right here..."" Rude. I wasn't super into any of the takeout meals, so I asked to see a dine in menu. They told me they don't make anything on the menu for takeout, so I could only see it if I waited for a table. And then she walked away, shaking her head obnoxiously. I totally would have dined in had I been treated with respect. Instead, I waited for the next grumpy staff member come to the counter and I ordered a hot dog that took 20 minutes to cook. Had I not been starving, I would have left. It cost way too much.

1031,cafes_list,"The Island Cafe is a cute little place right off the path from the Ward's Island ferry dock. It was recently featured on CBC radio but I came across it on a bike tour around the islands. It's only been open for a couple months and is under new ownership by a local Ward's Island family. The cafe is situated on a porch facing the north shore of Ward's Island. There is covered seating and couches on the porch, plus picnic tables and chairs out on the lawn. The place has a very campy feel to it. Ward's Island is the main neighbourhood island of the Toronto Islands so this cafe attracts a mix of locals, city folk and tourists but definitely nothing compared to the hot mess of tourists on Centre Island. I opted for a veggie dog which turned out to be one of the sausage-sized variety that looking very much like a real wiener. It came in a massive bun and was accompanied by your basic toppings of relish, mustard, and ketchup. At $4.20(taxes included), it was great value for the money and decently filling. The next person to order one at my recommendation was really taken a-back when she saw it, asking if it was really a veggie dog. The Island Cafe also has a good selection caffeinated drinks but it was way too hot for me to even consider an iced coffee so I went for the natural selection of the white jumbo freeze pop and was off on my bike adventure again.

They have bakery and hot breakfast items and some soup and sandwich type options for lunch. They also have pastry and dessert items, including gelato. Can't go wrong there. Our coffees tasted great. I ordered an americano with a splash of steamed soy milk. It was perfect. My friend ordered an almond milk caramel latte, which she said was average, and my partner ordered a black americano.

Track lighting is meant to give warm, pinpoint accent lighting and the CFL's are harsh and blue. Second, I ordered a BLT imagining it would be hard to screw up this sandwich. I sat and waited way too long as the ladies behind the counter chatted away. After more than 10 minutes someone yelled out ""did someone order a BLT?"" gesturing at the counter, where my sandwich had obviously been sitting for a while. At no point in the ordering process did they tell me how my sandwich would be delivered or announced. Apparently I was supposed to watch the counter. On to the sandwich. The BLT came on flavorless, doughy-white ciabatta type of bread and had lettuce hanging out a good two inches on all sides. The ingredients were jammed in in an unceremonious fashion, but nevermind, I thought. If it tastes good, I am happy. After folding the lettuce over so that I could actually take a bite, I realized that the bacon was extremely salty and tough. I lifted off the bread and saw that they had used bacon shaped into rounds, obviously manufactured for use on bacon cheeseburgers and other fast-food nastiness. The bacon was so salty and nasty that I couldn't taste the rest of the sandwich and literally had to choke the thing down. I'm afraid that Java Cat really falls short in a city that aspires to much more. Just down the road Crema Café does everything much better, with a flourish and a flair and with a real sense of customer service. The new Madison Sourdough cafe on Willy Street is a great gem of a place, raising the bar on casual breakfast and lunch fare even higher. The only thing that could possibly recommend Java Cat is their gelato, which is an unusual and refreshing offering on this side of the lake.",2-star,negative

Within a short walk I can indulge in just about any scoop or soft-serve delight the city has to offer. But somehow, I crave something different. It's hot enough to crave something chilly, but not so hot that I don't want butterfat. RIch. Creamy. Butter. Fat. Luckily, Jedds is just up the block. Featuring a limited menu of ""frozen custards"" alongside decent coffee and exquisitely pretty pastries, Jedds also has laid-back seating and a barista-cool vibe. Bring a date. Or your wife. Or both, if that's how your roll. I don't judge. That said, I'd eat their frozen custard sitting on a cardboard box in the street. It is supremely creamy; holding its structure long after the Dairy Queen cones of the world have given up the ghost. Fat carries flavours, and Jedds' are subtle. Coffee one day, maple the next, swirled with more standard flavours like milk chocolate or floral vanilla. If you're a fan of chunky ice cream, these treats are not for you. They're all about mouthfeel. and RIch. Creamy. Butter. Fat. My only criticisms of Jedd's are that it's too close (a longer walk would better burn the delicious, delicious calories), and in tribute to a certain US based frozen custard chain, I wish to God I could order a cookie puss.",4-star,positive
1065,cafes_list,"I loved it. On Yonge and Eglinton, definitely a great location. I'd gotten a waffle with chocolate frozen custard, and my friend got an Affogato with plain frozen custard.

It was a bit on the harder side, but as the custard seeped into the waffle, with the addition of strawberries, each bite was better than the last. The affogato. Well, what can I say? I haven't tried an affogato before, and this was indeed a revelation. The espresso with frozen custard? Awesome. The bitterness and caffeine of the espresso combined with the sweetness of the custard was definitely a great combination. The store itself had a pretty solid front. I chose to sit in the patio. It wasn't too shabby. The staff behind the counter was really friendly and he had solid suggestions. They even do lunch stuff! And me being a vegetarian, they seemed to have great veggie options for lunch. I'd definitely be back here, and this is definitely a great date spot.

It was pretty tasty but I'm a sucker for quiches so that's an easy sell for me :) The Dumas tart was Delicious. Don't know which part I liked best, maybe the wafer walls or the noisette mousse/custard. The crust was not the right texture and stuck to the plate but otherwise this was chocolatey nutty perfection. Disappointed that i got no latte art and it was a bitter brew. Also a bit let down by the selection ESP for cheesecakes. There was not much, see my pics and you'll see. Nothing like others' pics. So overall not a bad spot. I RECOMMEND- the Dumas TIP- seats are comfy but tables are kind of high for laptops/typing. Impractical. TIP 2 STAFF- the manager was screaming.

The ""affogato"" (two shots of espresso poured atop a small scoop of vanilla custard) is as amazing as they say it is, BUT at $5.95 plus tax ($6.37) it's too pricey to get on a regular basis.

I'm definitely interested in coming back to try their other types of dessert.",4-star,positive
1075,cafes_list,"I come here mainly for their single desserts which are delish! They have these apricot and raspberry cookies which are quite expensive but worth every bit! I also enjoy their pistachio danish when I can get my hands on them. Their frozen custard is nice and taste very fresh. The sweetness and color are just right, not excessive. Why do I care about color? Well because a very fresh place needs not use colouring as a crutch. They are confident enough in the flavour to leave the food dye alone and Jedd excels here. I do have to say that I am yet to really taste the difference between these and fresh ice cream. Perhaps I need to try them more often and it will come to me. In the mean time, when I occasionally indulge in the frozen custard, the strawberry is my absolute fave! I don't know why but natural, fresh, milky frozen desserts tend to shine in their strawberry offerings.",4-star,positive
1076,cafes_list,"LOVE. Affogato is phenomenal and quite addictive. Anything else with their frozen custard is great. It's like the creamiest, purest ice cream you've ever had. It's not shipped in--I saw them make it fresh right in front of me. There are always 3 flavours: vanilla, chocolate, and daily feature. They offer samples if you can't decide. Their staple chicken vegetable soup is available most days and is truly fantastic (and healthy). It is a meal in itself. It's a nice homemade slightly-spiced broth overflowing with lean tender chicken and garden veggies. No noodles, for all you carb-a-phobes! I was hesitant to pay $6 for a bowl of soup, but I'm so glad I did. The hot espresso drinks are a bit bitter and overpriced (vs. Aroma up the street) --that's my only complaint. But espresso with the affogato is just fine! Service is consistently good. Every staff member has been lovely and they don't mind if you crack out your laptop and hang out. It's a really chill environment and they obviously put a lot into their marble & wood interior. I've met THE Jedd and he's really nice, too!! Really hope this place does well. P.S.

1080,cafes_list,Jedd serves up an smooth delectable tasty frozen custard. It's not ice cream -- I know as I've been to several Andersen's Custards in the US. The single vanilla scoop I ordered at Jedd's was served in a ceramic cup which is a lot different from Andersen's where they dispense using a soft serve machine. I decided to spoil myself and add a slice of cinnamon apple pie to the order to create a pie a la mode. Jedd's frozen custard + cinnamon apple pie = match made in heaven. :D Jedd's frozen custard has a super smooth texture and unique taste. Personally I liked Jedd's custard better than Andersen's custard in the US. Tasted a stronger custard (egg) and real vanilla flavour in the scoop I had.,4-star,positive
1081,cafes_list,"Jedd's Frozen Custard is a great place to grab some coffee, enjoy a light meal or indulge in sweet treats, and of course, savouring their frozen custard. Despite their really ugly name, this place is pretty classy looking, narrow, clean and comfortable. The staff is super friendly and helpful too. The frozen custard comes in three flavours: chocolate, vanilla and one other flavour that changes each day. When I was there, the other flavour was strawberry, which I tried. The frozen custard was really rich; the texture was creamy and smooth. I like the frozen custard a lot, but if you're watching your diet, you may want to pass up on this because it contains lots of milk fat and egg yolk. For one small scoop, I paid over $3. They're other dessert options too such as cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, biscotti's, brownies, macaroons etc. Most of these desserts are really pricey though. For example, a small piece of cake is $5-$6. Personally, I love their gigantic cookies ($1.95), their crunchy from the outside and chewy on the inside. What I enjoy most of all here is the coffee beverages. I especially love their latte- strong coffee with creamy steamed organic milk, just perfect! The staff told me that the milk used at Jedd's is organic. Now I can enjoy my coffee beverages even more knowing I'm not sipping in hormone-pumped milk into my system. Besides coffee and desserts, you can also get some fresh yummy salads and sandwiches. Overall, Jedd's Frozen Custard is a great place to indulge in some great beverages and treats while sitting under pretty crystal chandeliers. Do expect the desserts to be on the pricey side though.",4-star,positive

Not sure how much for a whole pie. The continue to have the delightful personal-sized Rahier desserts, and macarons. They also have croissants, brownies, sandwiches, etc. And of course, the frozen custard, which I still have not seen offered anywhere else in Toronto. I do think that their prices are too high on some of the bakery items - a brownie comes to almost $4!

It was the perfect accompaniment to a piece of apple crumble that had the most wonderful crust, perfect in texture and taste. The biggest surprise was the latte. I didn't have very high expectations, even though a previous reviewer had raved about it. After all, the selling point of this place is the custard.

(they give u a little jug of real cream though). i've made peach tarts at home and it was the same, no reason why this regular sized peach tart should cost $5.75! wouldn't go back, though their interior is pretty and quaint and they have free wifi, just not a reasonable price for desserts that are nothing special. for that price i want a WOW factor which i felt was lacking, got more like a meh factor...which is fine if desserts were priced accordingly... we sampled the frozen custard which was good - so i'd recommend staying away from $$$ baked goods that u can get anywhere else for half-price and just going for the frozen custard. i frequent andy's frozen custard in chicago all the time - now that's a real frozen custard joint!",2-star,negative

1088,cafes_list,"My friend brought me to this little gem in the Yonge & Eg neighbourhood. I had never even heard of frozen custard prior to arriving at Jedd's. When I'm surrounded by desserts I can't think clearly. The kind gentleman behind the counter must have noticed and explained what they offered. Once I re-learned how to form sentences I ordered the espresso poured over frozen custard - a perfect combination of two of my favourite things. The obvious problem with what I ordered is that the hot espresso melts the frozen custard at a faster rate than I can consume my smectic A'* dessert. The espresso was perfect, complete with the right caramel colour and texture. The custard was rich and creamy, but not too sweet. Heavenly. I found the stark white décor a little cold, but maybe that's the idea. *Smectic A' is a state between solid and liquid: http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/98/0622/solid.html",4-star,positive

I have to admit, when I got my affogato I was a little surprised and wasn't really looking forward to eating my now melting custard with creamy-sugary espresso (I like my espresso with no sugar, no cream). I began to contemplate which I should start on. Should I sip the espresso while it's still relatively hot? Or should I start eating the custard while it's still in its frozen state? I opted for the frozen custard first and was quite pleased. I then sipped the espresso, which IMO was very well pulled. It was around this time I realized to really enjoy this dessert, I have to eat it together. I mean, why else would they combine the two? Wow, what a delight that combined bite/sip was. The creamy rich flavour of the combination of custard and espresso was inspiring! I've only been here once and am afraid of going back with my now high expecations. But this place has to be tried by all. Perhaps its not really Jedd's I loved, but more the affogato. So I'll give it 4/5 stars.

I had the Maple Walnut and quite enjoyed it as it had a CREAMY rich flavour that Custards have over simply Ice Cream. The couple young ladies working behind the counter were friendly and even asked our advice on new flavour ideas as it seems they can COMPOSE flavour combinations. They suggested a flavour profile and I said it might work because I just came from a Juice & Smoothie place that had that same combo. It is also a nice place that offers Coffee and Espresso Drinks where you can relax, chill and chat with a friend. They also had a note on the Menu Blackboard as well as notes on the table announcing a LIVE band will be here Friday, July 16th.

""What the heck is frozen custard and who'd eat it?"" I thought outloud to myself. The girl from behind the counter explained...kind of like ice cream and gelato...but insisted that I had to try it for myself to come up with my own explanation. I agreed. She asked if I wanted a free sample. ""Hell yeah!"" I responded. ""What flavour? We have tropical fruit, chocolate and one scoop of maple cream left..."" Feeling guilty about potentially stealing a spoonful of someone else's maple cream, I opted for chocolate. The sample came to me on a silver spoon and into my mouth it went.....and it was amazing. It was sinfully delicious, heaven in your mouth, and I was told that it had about the same amount of fat content as gelato. I'll see it to believe it. But for now, I'm sold on frozen custard.

After we arrived, it got quite busy, and truth be told, it was a bit cramped sitting on the bench against the window. The food is fresh, and seemingly good quality. The prices were somewhat high, but probably on point for the area in which they are located. The soup we ordered was a split pea soup, that I thought *might* be similar to the ""snert"" which is a dutch split pea soup, but it was actually quite bland. We also ordered some salads, and a grilled cheese for our one year old.

The decor is unique and clearly very thoroughly considered (love the floors and wood ceilings to warm up a largely black and white space, as well as the slick tree common table). The bathrooms are absolutely worth a visit. The service was the best part of our night, incredibly friendly and informative. Mark took the time to talk us through the dining concept, recommended some great vegetarian and vegan options, and brought us our food in a flash. We ended up having a great discussion about local craft beers, he introduced me to some promising options around the city, and even let me try a few cans of Sidelaunch.

Another delicate pastry was included, and a side of fresh apple sauce and fresh fruit salad was included, which was the perfect end to cut the breakfast. Beatrice was kind to refill my cup everytime I asked.

1100,cafes_list,Pas du tout fan du nouveau principe de payer à l'avance et d'être servis par après.

1102,cafes_list,"The line-up was quite daunting there on a Saturday morning: a sure sign of a good bakery. It moved quickly though, the employees were very friendly and efficient. There's an extensive cheese selection, including many locally-produced ones, and an array of sandwiches, but the real fun is when you get to the desserts and pastries section. We tried the chocolate-pistachio mini danoise (which was not mini at all), and the apple-raspberry danoise (which pleasantly surprised us because it was filled with real fruits and not jam!). All their pastries are made with pure butter, as per the French tradition. You can take your goodies to go, or sit down and order from their menu. They also have a small boutique, where you can buy a variety of coffee beans, homemade sweets and frozen pastries.",5-star,positive
1103,cafes_list,"Everything here was so yummy! I had the ham and Brie panini, latte, carrot cake, kouign aman, and the MOST AMAZING olive pesto bread. The sandwich was good but nothing amazing. Definitely come here to try the pastries and bread... Those made the trip worth it!",5-star,positive

Quoi de plus satisfaisant que de mordre à belles dents dans une bonne baguette chaude, à peine sortie du four? Je suis constamment à la recherche de petites boulangeries, dirigées par des passionnés et je suis bien tombée ici! J'ai déjeuné avec un café allongé et un pain au chocolat. Très français, ce petit--déjeuner! La chocolatine était de bonne taille, feuilletée à souhait avec un bon chocolat noir et l'amertume du café offrait un joyeux contraste en bouche avec la viennoiserie. En passant, si ça vous intéresse, il y a aussi des sandwichs, des quiches et des pâtés. Les pains ont l'air vraiment appétissants et il y a une section de produits à emporter comme des biscuits, des confitures et du café de Toi et Moi.

Le remède à la croute en carton, la mie fade et mole de leur pain est malheureusement le grille-pain, suivi d'une couche de beurre. Quant au pain au chocolat, il n'a jamais aussi bien porté son nom, car oui, j'avais vraiment l'impression d'avoir du pain autour d'une tablette de chocolat.

1112,cafes_list,"I went to Montreal to visit my sister who lives 2 blocks from this place, which is the only reason we ended up going there. I may be wrong but it doesn't seem like a neighborhood you would normally visit as a tourist, so you may not have a reason to really try this place. But if you are around, I highly recommend stopping by! They have a pretty good selection of cheese, meat and sandwiches to go but their pastries and bread are excellent (just like in France!) Their sit-down lunch menu is also great and very reasonable priced (5 or 6 bucks for a delicious sandwich + salad!). Table service is nice and friendly but you service at the counter for to-go orders is a bit chaotic. All in all a great stop if you're in the neighborhood.",5-star,positive

1115,cafes_list,"Bubble tea on a next level thing. Was quite excited to visit and just the thought of handpicking all the ingredients made it worth the while. This place has such a cute and unique take on a scientists (in little lab coats) concocting delicious bubble teas at will. Interesting theme and it just makes so much sense. I truly like the idea how there is someone at the front who is ready to explain all the flavors and combinations all the while providing you with excellent recommendations. You literally walk in, take a metal tray and choose items from little test tubes, syringes and petri dishes. There are so many flavors to choose, types of sugars, and flavored boba to choose from - like NOTHING I have seen before. I wish they had more locations as this is a perfect way to ensure accuracy and perfect boba everytime.",5-star,positive
1116,cafes_list,"This place is pretty cool. You get to choose the base for your drink, and all the little details that go into making bubble tea. To be quiet honest, the line wasn't totally worth the wait. I mean I did want to try something new, the options were a little intimidating because well what do I know about mixing flavors for drinks. Maybe I'm just boring, but I'd rather just go to a regular bubble tea place and pick a flavor from the menu. It was an experience. I'll leave it at that.",2-star,negative
1117,cafes_list,"This was definitely an interesting take to having bubble tea. I enjoyed the whole interactive process of creating your own beverage with a huge selection of options! Something I did regret though was adding the raspberry powder in spite of the warnings I did get from the ""Scientists"" (they warned me three times that it doesn't mix well, which I should have taken into consideration because it was VERY true). The whole process would determine the cost based on what you chose to add into your beverage, and they mix it for you too which was pretty nifty. I especially love how they call customers ""Doctor"", which definitely made the experience more immersive. I would definitely go again, I'd just be sure to avoid the raspberry powder and try one of the juice based bubble teas!",5-star,positive
1118,cafes_list,"I like it because: - Unique concept of getting your bubble tea fix compared to other bbt stores - Huge variety of flavours, toppings, sugar and milk. - Beautiful before and after - Insta-worthy. I don't like it because: - For cold drinks, they ""recommend"" you to get 2 syringes or 2 test tubes. I didn't want to pay much as each syringe you get is +$1 but I was told that I have to get 2 otherwise the flavour won't be strong enough so I got 2 and it tasted too sweet for me. The next time, I wanted to get 1 only again and was told the same thing. I then explained that I found it too sweet so I'd prefer to take 1, she recommended me to get 2, and for the 2nd one, to ask the cashier that I want only half or a quater (??) What's the point of paying another $1 if I'll be using only a fraction of it? I might just get the sugar for free. - Expensive. For a cold drink, the average price is $5.75 + tax (with 1 topping).",3-star,negative

1121,cafes_list,"finally had the chance to come try this place out after all the hype. very impressed with my drink (lychee peach green tea with strawberry and lychee pearls) the price was around $7 i believe. there are many flavours to choose from and you can get either milk tea or regular tea or slush. the flavours are very accurate so you should be careful with the flavours you choose as some combinations might taste a little weird. there are a lot of toppings to choose from but for the pearl and boba, they are different. pearl is the ones that pop juices into your mouth and boba is the chewy tapioca. the place is also pretty big with wifi haha. i came around 5:45 on a friday night and it wasn't that busy. the workers are also super nice and helped us out with ordering. i would come back to try other flavour combinations since you probably can't get some combinations else where.",5-star,positive

1124,cafes_list,"I love the concept of this place. The lab theme certainly attracts people fond of sharing novelties on social media (like me). However, I think this shop needs more commitment to the theme. We were lucky to hit an off-peak hour at around 2pm on a Wednesday, but do expect a bit of a line. When you walk in, you take a cup, pick milk or fruit tea, and select your flavours, all held in vials. You can then add sugar (held in syringes), as well as toppings (stored in petri dishes). This is where the lab theme stops, as you just hand a staff your tray of ingredients and wait for your drink. I assumed that we would be physically making our own bubble tea, or customized lab concoction. For $6-$7 per drink, I would have loved to see this extension of the interactive aspect. I picked milk tea with honeydew and coconut, as well as 30% sugar and tapioca. The coconut was recommended by one of the attendants, but I don't know how well it meshed with the honeydew. I had heard from friends that their drinks were very sweet, but I think this only applies to the fruit teas. There was a sign recommending evaporated milk with milk teas, so there was an extra 50c added there, making my total to be over $7. My boyfriend got a mango/lychee fruit tea with lychee pearls. The cashier seemed to be new, and forgot to charge my boyfriend for his toppings. Right before he paid, another staff caught the error, so his total ended up being $6.50. The quality is just below or on-par with other stores such as Chatime. I love the idea, but not sure if it's worth the premium price.",4-star,positive
1125,cafes_list,"Labothery was so aggressively average that I didn't even sit down after I got my drink. It is definitely an IG hype and is pretty cute. The idea is that you go into the ""lab"" and create your own drink. They have everything in test tubes and little petri dishes. 1. You choose hot/cold 2. You choose milk tea or fruit flavored - which you grab by the tubes (powder or syrup) 3. You choose your sweetness 4. You choose your toppings Each of these add up and you get your total at the end. Your name will be called ""Dr. Lo"" when your drink is ready. Concept is pretty novel and the workers were working as hard as they can but omg the line was so long and the bubbletea was so average. It's a novelty thing which I'm glad I tried out but won't come again.",2-star,negative
1126,cafes_list,"Pretty cool concept! You can basically make any type of tea you want - you can choose between milk tea, fresh tea, or slush and whether you want a syrup or powder flavor... so may options! I tried the banana and white chocolate powder milk tea and it was great, although the banana was a little overpowering. You also get to choose your type of toppings - boba, tapioca etc., and level of sweetness. From all the reviews it seemed that people were saying to go with two evaporated milks, however the staff member said that that would probably be too much, so I went with one and it was good enough The staff there are all really helpful and give good advice of flavor combinations, especially if you can't make up your mind - it can be overwhelming! Also be prepared to wait a long time - the line-up is from the counter all the way to the door and it took us about an hour to get to the front to start ordering! Its a really unique place and would recommend coming at least one time for the experience.",4-star,positive
1127,cafes_list,"If you want to get experience for making your own bubble tea, you can go to this place. I went there on Sunday, it was really busy and such a long lineup (almost wait for 30mins to choose it). the staff was helpful tho. But, it is enough for going there once. Just for experience. Cute and smart idea :) Plus, My bubble tea was not good as i expected..",3-star,negative
1128,cafes_list,"This bubble tea place is really cute and innovative. I saw the syringes and test tubes online and of course I fell in love and decided to venture in here, but it's really just all hype. We came on a weekday afternoon, and there was no lineup, so we could take our time deciding what to pick. The staff is pretty helpful in the choosing process so that we wouldn't end up with a terrible combination. The whole place is themed, which I love! Even the tables were the type used in examinations. We both picked fruity, cold drinks. So I did a double syringe of rose syrup (cold drinks required 2 syringes), green tea base, and picked up lychee boba, and it cost $6.50... which is really expensive for a rather generic bubble tea order. The drink tasted okay too, nothing special, and would have been acceptable if it was under $5 like CoCo or the Alley. You really just come here for the experience of mixing your bubble tea. I would say it's fun to come in once, but I wouldn't make it my go-to bbt joint.",3-star,negative
1129,cafes_list,"SUPER FUN EXPERIENCE ! I kept my creation pretty tame at a Rose Lychee Green tea with Aloe vera. Overall, the flavours came through and it tasted nice. //THE ATMOSPHERE// Labothéry uses the concept of being your own 'scientist' and formulating your own drink. There's a wall with instructions as well as an employee behind the test tube flavour rack who will help you along your bubble tea making adventure :) I loved all the details since it really made you feel like you're in a laboratory! From the lab bench-like tables, toppings in Petri dishes, test tubes, lab coat wearing employees, and they even call you 'Dr. [insert name]'! //OVERALL THOUGHTS// It can get very expensive depending on the amount of add-ons and flavours you put in. But I'd say it's worth it to check out at least once just to get this unique science-meets-bubble tea experience!",4-star,positive
1130,cafes_list,"The concept behind this store is interesting and definitely makes it unique. It makes the bubble tea creation process more interactive; however, at the end of the day it is fairly gimmicky. Might not be a good idea if you're very indecisive! You start by choosing if you want: 1) hot or cold 2) milk based or syrup based - which flavours you want 3) sugar levels - maple ($1 extra), brown, or regular 4) milk (evaporated or fresh) 5) toppings (boba, jellies, tapioca) 6) tea (green, black, oolong) To select the flavour and sugar level you select the tube that you want, and when you're ready you give it all to the staff or ""scientists"" will combine everything together for you. I got the red bean, sesame with ""original"" (they recommend you get it). When I asked what tea would work well, they suggested a green tea. Even though I wouldn't come back for the experience, I did think that this was a really good combination! It had a really strong fragrance, and the flavours blended really well (my friends couldn't figure out what was inside when they tried it). There's not a lot of seating either, it's pretty minimalistic. Also, there's a durian flavour, and at one point it was extremely pungent (and slightly nauseating.)",4-star,positive
1131,cafes_list,"I came here in a trip from New York super excited to try this place from seeing it on a video from social media. The concept is super cute and all, but sadly it was a let down. You walk in and immediately you see syringes with flavored syrups, test tubes of flavored milk tea powder, and syringes of sugar. I have to admit I was pretty excited, but all I really wanted was a plain milk tea. They did have someone standing there talking to customers and giving suggestions, but if there's a line forming behind you, it's hard to not feel pressured to take what you think you need and go. The worker was super nice, I told her I wanted just a plain milk tea. She told me to grab two original test tubes of powder and sugar, she suggested the highest level of sugar and I told her I usually don't take my drinks sweet and asked if the tea has a strong tea flavor so I settled for the syringe of 20ml? Of sugar with it. They had a fridge of different flavored popping bobas, aloe, jelly, and tapioca. I chose to have black tea as my base. I paid about $6? I think. This place follows through with the whole lab theme as they call customers doctor to pick up their drink. Excited to finally take a sip of my drink, I was super disappointed. There was no tea taste, and little trace of sugar. I'm usually fine with no sugar if the tea flavor was strong, but at this point I felt like I was just drinking milk powdered flavored water. I took a few sips and tossed it out. My other friends had a better experience but wasn't amaze with their drinks either. I would suggest maybe a list or menu of suggested or popular combinations, the process can be overwhelming because there are so many choices of everything and it's hard to think about what will go well together. The workers were nice and patient. The place has a lot of space and minimalistic detail. The products themselves are just lacking.",3-star,negative
1132,cafes_list,"Although the theme of the place is cute, underneath all of the lab decorations it is just a regular boba shop.

I would reccomend if You are into bubble tea but I wouldn't expect anything out of this world.",4-star,positive
1133,cafes_list,Checked out this cute lab-themed bubble tea shop and it was pretty cool. The interior was spacious with plenty of seating. It took me a while to decide on which flavour to try and finally settled on making a unique combination with durian and banana flavoured bubble tea powder with maple syrup. It was pretty tasty and adding evaporated milk made the drink a bit creamier. It is an interesting concept but can get pretty pricey if you add too many toppings. Overall it was a great experience and would likely go again to make some crazy combinations.,4-star,positive
1134,cafes_list,"Underwhelming to say the least. The line was extremely long and it was a bit confusing at first. I think the menu should better explain the process of what order things are picked out rather than having to wait on an employee to explain. It also would have been nice if they had a list recommended combinations. I ended up getting a mango lychee drink which was yummy, but for the price that I paid - nearly $7 - it was not worth it.",2-star,negative

1137,cafes_list,"These new bubble tea shops opening up every minute really takes a toll on my bank account. And my health. Nonetheless, I obviously had to try this place out because build-your-own anything is super trendy and when you slap a cute lab theme on it you can be sure I'm on board. After a ridiculous amount of time in line (understandable since a certain city's blog made a post about it ), my friends and I got to the flava station. I won't delve too much into the process of creating your drink, but you pay for each ingredient you pick with some certain limits and restrictions. I combined matcha and raspberry powder for my milk tea and was told twice that it was a risky combination. Little did they know I like living life on the edge. After waiting an hour in line, paying ~$7 for my drink, telling myself ""ignore the haters, you have great taste and this drink is gonna be revolutionary"" and receiving my finished concoction, all I could say was ""WOW! This is bland! I'm disappointed!"" Not a hint of matcha, but that might be because it was overpowered by the not-raspberry raspberry flavour. I did try my friend's and it, too didn't blow my socks off. Would I come back to try another combination? Nah. I really did want to like this place, but there's better quality bubble tea without the gimmicks, so I don't think I'll be returning.",3-star,negative
1138,cafes_list,"Cool but sorta broken concept. The entire set up is cafeteria style where you pick and choose exactly what you want to go in your beverage sort of making this a very personal type of concept. After going thru what's what and if I can put this with that. I chose matcha and coconut powder base, 60% sugar with milk and in a slushy format. It didn't turn out the way I would've wanted it to, the flavours were very muted and although my drink was green it didn't have a matcha taste AT ALL. My girlfriend got a peach mango green tea with mango boba and it was actually pretty good. The total for the two drinks was $13 tax in which is a little more expensive than competitors down the street. until they change how they have their tapioca laid out I would recommend AGAINST getting it as a topping because it's just hard and chewy when it is left out the way it is. The staff were friendly guiding thru the steps with unfamiliar customers. They have 2-3 baristas working making the line more bearable considering it moved in a decent pace. The tea-shop is not crammed at all and is easy to navigate thru as it is vey spaced out. Overall I would give another chance but coming here would not be my first opinion so who knows when that is going to happenS .",3-star,negative
1139,cafes_list,"Went last night to check it out and the line was quite long. Waited 30 min before I got my drink. It's a little expensive for bubbletea but the flavours were good and the experience/ decor is interesting It's $3.25 for a cup, $1/flavour, $0.50/topping and you get a choice of oolong, black and green tea. One thing I didn't like was customer service. They were quite slow with the drinks and the cashier made me second guess my order. I get she was trying to help but asking ""are you sure you want this?"" Right before I pay is not helpful. Flavours were pretty good but don't think I'll be coming back",3-star,negative
1140,cafes_list,"Another place that I checked out because of a BlogTO feature - long story short, I would only recommend going here once for the aesthetic but not multiple times thereafter! This is basically a lab-themed bubble tea shop where you pick your own flavors and toppings. You pick a hot or cold drink, flavor profile, sugar (white/brown/maple syrup - 10/20/30%), milk, and tapioca vs jelly (different flavors). I'll give them credit for trying a new concept in a city where aesthetic is everything, but they still need to iron a lot of wrinkles out. Honestly it's pretty confusing what flavors you can/can't combine, and the guy at the front explaining can't keep up with the volumes of customers. Essentially you can't combine the syrup flavors (cold drink) with the powder flavors (hot drinks) and can pick up to 1 or 2 flavors depending on if you get a hot or cold drink. I went with two other people, and we all tried different flavors but came to the same conclusion - the flavors do not mix well at all! My matcha coconut milk tea didn't come out as expected at all, and my friends said the same for their drinks. Price wise, this place is ridiculously expensive. I get it - you're paying for the novelty of the concept but charging $3.25 for a cup, $1 per flavor, $0.5-1 for milk, and $1 per topping means that each drink comes out to around $7-8. The only thing that's free is the sugar, and even that costs extra if you want maple syrup instead of white/brown sugar. There are much better bubble tea places in the city that don't break the bank!",3-star,negative
1141,cafes_list,"Went here for the first time and had such a fun experience. If it's your first time there someone usually helps you out pick whether you want a fruit tea or milk tea and how much sugar you would like either reg, brown sugar or maple syrup. They even notice your flavors that you choose and will even tell you which ones go best together. It's a bit on the pricey side since they charge per flavor and topping. I got two toppings, two flavors and soy milk so it added up to about $8 for milk tea and there's only one size just letting you know. The whole experience was great and worth the wait and am willing to go back again!!",4-star,positive

Will definitely come back again.",4-star,positive
1143,cafes_list,"There's a plethora of bbt places in the downtown core, but obviously what sets this place apart is the ability to customize. No, i'm not talking about % of sugar, or % of ice you can add, but your entire drink. You can mix flavors you would not be able to do so at another franchise, and add as many toppings as you'd like (from what they offer). The science lab theme of this place is also unique and makes it really cute. As a science graduate myself, the syringes, petri dishes, test tubes, sample jars etc was funny to me, but I'm sure it adds to the experience for others. You start off with a sterile tray, picking either a hot/cold cup for your drink. They also instruct you on how many test tube (of tea flavors) to add to your drink (2x for cold drinks, 1x for hot). You move on to a slew of test tube tray racks, where you can choose which tea flavor you'd like. The choices range from fruity flavors (peach etc) to milk tea powders (durian, red bean etc). You can also choose your level of sweetness with various types of sugar too (regular sugar syrup, brown sugar etc). Around the corner, you'll get to choose your toppings (boba - the ones that explode in your mouth, pearls - what they described as harder than tapoica, jelly etc) in petri dishes. They also have evaporated milk as an option, which they recommended based off your customized drink to enhance the flavor and add some creaminess. Finally, when you get to the register, you have an option of a 3 different tea bases. I found it a cute touch how each of the cups have ""DR."" printed on them, where they write your name on it (so they call you as ""DR. _____""). My friends and I all chose a milk tea, which we all agreed was not as spectacular as we would have expected. However, I've heard that their customized fruity teas are really enjoyable, so I'm looking forward to going back and giving those a try. I usually get a small size at any bbt place I go to, but unfortunately at this place they only offer 1 size.",3-star,negative
1144,cafes_list,"Decided to check out Labothery after someone in my Yelp Facebook group let us in on the secret about this place. It looks like they recently launched and they offer your typical powder and syrup bubble tea, but everything is made to look like you are picking samples from a scientist's laboratory. The staff are dressed in white lab coats and it looks like they are mixing secret chemicals together to concoct your drink. The lab is quite spacious with barstool type seating. Upon entering you are supposed to pick up a small metal tray and start by deciding whether you want a cold or hot drink. Then you pick different ingredients, which are packaged in little tubes or syringes for your drink. I found that the staff were not so helpful in making recommendations for the drinks and as this place gets busier, I can see that it will be difficult to ensure that the line-ups of indecisive but intrigued customers can be moved quickly. Instructions on what can be picked are uncleared and it's only when we got to the counter that they told us that some of the ingredients chosen would not go well together. All of the flavours are quite standard. They have tapioca and bobas in little petri dishes. Oh yeah, and the milk toppings are in pee cups... yup the pee cups that doctors give you to pee in. Good laugh at that one!",3-star,negative
1145,cafes_list,"Amazing dinner at Larry's and we're glad our friend recommended us to Larry's! The service was friendly and the food are amazing! All dishes are sharing plates, which means you get to taste more amazing dishes. :) We ordered: King mushroom - so buttery and delicious. The thick cut of king mushroom is the perfect bite! Asparagus - cooked perfectly crispy and well seasoned. Artichoke - delicious, and tangy with some delicious sesame seeds and spice! Rare beef with chimichurri sauce - succulent tender beef strips dressed in a delicious chimichurri sauce! Fried potatoes - crispy on the outside and super fluffy on the inside!

1146,cafes_list,"It was super spontaneous when I decided to come to Larrys for brunch. Lawrence was going under renovations so Larrys was next best option. Their breakfast is served tapas style. They are all smaller dishes and it's a great place to order a whole bunch of items on the menu and share them. It does add up (price) but it's worth it. Their scrambled eggs are amazing; they are super runny and way different what you would expect. Their king oyster mushrooms are soooo good. I don't know what they serve underneath the mushrooms but its heavenly. Their toast is also really good, but they do put a lot of butter on it. The place is super small, so it's not ideal for groups. The wait wasn't too bad but it's best if you go early.",4-star,positive

It did take a long time (like 45') for the food to arrive (including the salad) but it was well worth waiting for. The roasted skate wing was totally delicious--fresh, sweet, well seasoned. The salad was a wonderful inventive combination of crunchy winter vegetables in a beautiful presentation, lightly dressed with a perfect French vinaigrette.

Had breakfast to lunch here and the scrambled eggs are amazing traditional rillettes to an outstanding tuna ceviche and whelks.

1152,cafes_list,"Great food and excellent service sums up this review! I came here with my son based on a recommendation from his roommate. Their menu has a flair towards southern cuisine elevated by a few levels. Since we were there for brunch, I ordered the heirloom tomato salad which consisted of the freshest home grown tomatoes that I haven't had in a long time with fried bread. The flavors were amazing. Then I tried their mashed potatoes mixed with cabbage and fried in lard... simply tasty but not greasy. The fact that they serve small plates - tapas style - you get a treat without over indulging, unless you order another plate! For a place that was so crowded, the service was great. I eat out a lot because I travel. This place should definitely be listed as a go to spot on TripAdvisor because it's a gem that everyone should get a chance to enjoy.",5-star,positive
1153,cafes_list,"The most adorable tapas cafe in Montreal. In a quiet corner off Saint-Laurent, Larrys is a cozy cafe great for a date or dinner with friends. I went with my boyfriend and another couple and we shared the bread which was fresh and soft, carrots with muhammara, heirloom tomatoes, corn bread with succotash, cauliflower, beef tartare, tuna ceviche, eggplant with zaatar, chicken liver toast, tangerine creme and peanut butter chocolate tart. All items were tasty and different. We loved the variety in cuisines, textures, and spices. My favorites were the carrots and eggplant, but would definitely order all again. We also tried an orange wine which we learned about in Montreal. It's similar to a rose in that the wine rests for a short time on the skins of the grape, but it has a deeper taste that has a red wine mouth feel. Would recommend trying one if you haven't. Enjoy larrys for us!!",5-star,positive

It's dark and intimate, and the bring food out as its ready. For a tapas place in Montreal, Larry's has my heart as my favourite one. Whenever I go, I make sure to order the fllamkuken & beed tartare. Last time I went they had a fish of the day, and that was incredible.",5-star,positive

I jumped on Yelp to find an alternative and Larry's fit the bill. The warm-up cappuccino was on point while we reviewed our options. The wife went for scrambled eggs and lox while I opted for buttered toast, eggs and mushrooms. My eggs were served sunny side up, cooked the way I like um (runny yoke with a set white) and perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms were cooked whole with herbs and butter--- super savory! The toast was equally tasty. The lox were tender and well balanced with a herby gently scrambled egg... I had a very nice cup of perfectly roasted black drip coffee to wrap the meal. The place is intimate and the staff was kind. There were a couple of families with well mannered small kids enjoying delicious looking pastry and sipping hot chocolate. Definitely worth stoping in if you are in the area!",5-star,positive
1158,cafes_list,"Have been here three times. Twice for date nights. Love the cosy intimate vibe. Once on a Saturday night (busy, lively) and once on a Monday night (super chill). The other time for just a glass of wine and dessert on a Thursday night (busy but seated right away). Love the casual but sophisticated atmosphere. Love the concept of small sharing plates as you get to work your way through the menu. The portions are good for 2-3 people max so not great for big groups if everyone wants to try. I'd say it's on the pricier side for the size of portion you get although ingredients are always fresh and each dish is carefully thought out and delicious. For one of the meals between two hungry people: seabass ceviche, tuna tartare, crab toast (this one is piled high), the aubergine cassoulet, potatoes, lamb cabbage rolls. Everything was delicious, really enjoyed. Would be interested in returning more frequently if their menu changed more often so could try more things. Staff was informative about the food and able to describe the items on the menu in detail and clearly know about the food. This always helps. It shows they care about the food they're serving and this goes a long way! *UPDATE* had a couple more meals i couldn't fault! Bingo! All the above still applies yet an added star as I think they have become more generous with their portions. 3 people: 3 glasses of wine, 2 cocktails, maybe 5-6 sharing dishes - we were full and happy! Around $50 per person. I'd say for a quality meal with exceptional service it's an easy 5star! It's local, independent - i struggle to fault it.",5-star,positive

1160,cafes_list,"Mon avis est un peu mitigé concernant le Larry's... On M'avait beaucoup parlé de ce brunch pour le cadre, le gout et les produits... c'est peut etre parce que j'en attendais plus mais j'ai été décu. Le cadre est sympa certes mais c'est petit. Le service et souriant et sympa Coté nourriture c'est un peu moins bien. Je regrette que pour un brunch il n'y ait pas de menu brunch. En fait tout est a la carte. En prenant le sandwich déjeuné à 9$ je pensais avoir de quoi manger mais franchement c'est un peu limite pour ce prix la. Certes la carte est grande et il y a de quoi manger mais pour avoir l'équivalent en quantité d'autre restaurant il vous faudra mettre 2 fois plus cher je pense.

Les plats sont vraiment raffinés et cuisinés de façon que ça a beaucoup de goût! A noter, quand nous y sommes allées (un dimanche matin), il n'y avait qu'une sorte de jus: pomme. Sinon, il y a des cafés (toutes sortes je crois?). L'endroit est assez petit, et souvent plein, alors attendez vous à attendre 30mn pour une table (mais ça vaut la peine!).

She said you have to order food. And I said well we aren't hungry can we order the nuts? She said you have to order at least 3 things. What? I'm not ordering three things when I literally just ate. We then said should we just leave then? She went and talked to the manager and said we could stay. Yeah after that felt real welcome. She said they aren't a wine bar well guess what on yelp you are and in the US that means you can simply enjoy a glass of wine. Very rude and unwelcoming.

1165,cafes_list,"Cozy, comfy, and remarkably consistent! Larry's is open all day, every day, and whether you're stopping for a coffee, a quick bite, or to dine and drink, you're surely guaranteed to enjoy a wonderful experience! Dishes are on point, staff is friendly, and the ambiance is absolutely charming. Here's a tip: early Saturday and Sunday mornings are a good time to lounge, enjoy a perfectly executed breakfast, sip from a warm cup of coffee and and take the time to breathe right. A secret retreat for some ""me time"" or perfect spot to meet up with friends! Note to young parents, bring your babies & kids - they'll enjoy the company. Depending on when you come, you'll meet Kim at the barista station, efficient Camille or kind and attentionate Lisa to help you order. Here you'll be served coffee made from the Heart Roasters based out of Portland OR. Even though the CAD-USD currency exchange rate is currently pretty horrible, the owners nonetheless make the effort to bring us the good quality beans while maintaining at very reasonably priced cup of coffee. Tucked in the back are 'Fearless & Feminine' chef Mary and 'Born to Cook' chef Korlin who deliver an unstoppable amount of appealing and amazing tasty dishes from the tiniest and most optimized kitchen ever - pay attention to details such as the small racks of eggs and spice containers magnetically attached to the vent. If you get there early enough you can witness the transformation of little white pale balls of dough into golden and delicious English muffins that make the base of the succulent breakfast sandwiches. Bubbles are mashed potatoes combined with grilled leaks. Mushrooms are sautéed with chives and butter. Eggs are prepared your way, with thick bacon or crispy sausage and toasted buttered square bread. Scrambled eggs are simply divine - creamy, buttery, rich and slightly runny! For lunch or later, try the spaghetti, cucumber salad, tomato salad, pork chop, or creamed cabbage all sure hits but I must confess and have yet to try the rest of the menu and indulge in some wine and cocktails.

I don't even like breakfast as a meal that much but Larrys showed me that it can indeed be my favorite meal. I ordered the smoked sturgeon, scrambled eggs, toast, bubble+squeak, kale and white bean soup, and sausage. Everything was spectacular. The smoked sturgeon drizzled with olive oil was supremely rich in flavor and texture without the dryness due to oversmoking/cooking. The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and seasoned being slightly wet and luscious. The sausage was so succulent and soft I almost thought it was undercooked but it wasnt. I've never encountered bubble and squeak before but it turned out to be a skillet crisped mixture of potatoes and cabbage that was the embodiment of heaven. With the day being so cold the soup gave my body the rejuvenating warmth it desperately needed and made my knees quiver with the sublime richness on the palate most vegetable soups are loathe to fulfill. Needless to say o will be going back there tomorrow and vainly wish this restaurant was in my hometown of new York city. So far this is the only restaurant in montreal that I wish this of.

We walked in because the door was open, no sign was showing closed and there was at least three tables still eating. We wait at the door with smiles, excited and the staff (3 behind the bar, 2 in the open kitchen) don't look at us. Finally the 3 behind the bar look at us and talk to each other and one walks over, no smile. We are told they are closed. Ok, no big deal. But they were so unpleasant, especially compared to the old business that was in the same location before them. Like we did something so wrong to walk in, then to cap off the experience when we asked what are the daily hours, since we thought it was open later he said, ""We close early on Sunday because we deserve time off too"" Wow!

This location has a lot of take out food options including sandwiches, sushi and hot food but not as good as MLG, but I usually am here for a restocking of the pantry, not lunch or dinner.

I keep telling myself: it's Toronto; there's traffic; get used to it. Formerly a 24 hr a day location, hours have been reduced from 7 am to midnight. Take a cart up the nifty escalators that the shopping carts adhere to by way of some mysterious feat of modern day engineering or find carts, but not always, stashed beside the second floor landing.

Extra points: - ALWAYS gorgeous produce - Great place to go for lunch - they have one of those take-away marche-type areas where you can get a variety of meals to eat there (at a few bistro tables) or take home. GREAT soup, sandwiches/wraps/paninis, sushi, pizza, hot stuff like chicken, fries, mac & cheese, rice pilaf, etc. Best lunch feature in my mind? The fresh salad bar in the produce section - check it out! You can build the salad of your dreams!!! - Other ""stores"" within the building: Dry Cleaners, Florist, Cigar/Smoke Shop, PC Financial, Travel Agent...",5-star,positive
1196,cafes_list,"Alright people, let's just put it out there - the reason we all come here: It has a separate Joe Fresh store. Admit it. Which one of us is really going grocery shopping without swinging by the Joe's to check out the latest and greatest items? Aside from a plethora of fashion goodness, this is the Loblaws I frequent when I really want a special night on the ..... grocers. It is my second favourite Loblaws in the city - and purely for poshiness. I find that in general most Loblaws have similar offerings, but most don't have such a fancy prepared food area (complete with a faux outdoor-ish eating space upstairs). Aside from the food and the clothes it has the ramp escalator thingee. That, my friends, is super fun. I don't know why, but it amuses me. Five Stars!",5-star,positive
1197,cafes_list,"I said before that The Dominion grocery store in Liberty Village was my favourite, but I take it back. This Loblaws is the best grocery store I have been to in the city, hands down. Their selection of produce is unparallelled. Everything is fresh, and the store is always well stocked. They have a great fresh fish and meat section. Their selection of cheeses is pretty spectacular, too. I also notice that they have comparably lower prices than Dominion, but my friend pointed out that might be because it's not 24 hours. Anyway, I noticed a lot of the stuff, including non-perishables, were quite a bit cheaper. And don't go through the prepared-food section if you're hungry because it will be impossible to leave without buying something. All the prepared sandwiches, pastas, soups and pastries look and smell delicious and I have never been disappointed eating there. I think what I love most about this grocery store is how open and bright it is - tons of natural light and windows. It makes that dreaded weekly grocery shopping experience just slightly more manageable. If you live in the area, I highly recommend you check this place out.",5-star,positive
1198,cafes_list,"Without a doubt, one of my favorite supermarkets....anywhere! I first visited this super-huge market back in 1998 and it was way ahead of its' time back then and in many ways it still is. You enter by going up a slanted walkway to the second floor (first floor is a series of small shops including an LCBO since Canadian supermarkets can't sell booze....boo!) right to a small restaurant area with fresh soups, sandwiches, muffins and other baked goods. Then a huge produce area awaits followed by a large bakery area offering Loblaws own baked goods alongside breads from bakeries like Ace and cakes from Dufflet (including the new frozen desserts) and LaRocca. Then you go to the organic/natural food area, the bulk area and a huge frozen food section among all the other good stuff. President's Choice is the boutique store brand and it rocks with so many options. You want frozen Jamablaya? They got that? Organic Oatmeal. PC Organics has that. They also have a No Name generic brand that's pretty good too. I usually leave with a big thing of their Peanut Butter because it's so good and denser than typical US PB's. Just a fantastic store and it's just too bad to hear that the corporate parent is suffering financially.",5-star,positive
1199,cafes_list,"Awesome experience for lunch today at MAD greens North Scottsdale location! My boyfriend and I both ordered the TY Cobb salad with extra MAD spice and blue cheese dressing. They had incredible flavor and for the regular size it really is filling!!! Didn't expect how filling it would be so that was a great surprise. The bacon is delicious that they put on the salads, so crunchy! Their drink selection is great too with a lot of different options, I went for the diet Mexican cola.

1200,cafes_list,I normally love Mad Greens but I typically go to the one on Central. My husband and I ordered salads for pick up today. When he brought them home - my salad had bitter undercooked quinoa in it. I tied to call the Scottsdale location but their message says they don't pick up the phone during peak times. It was outside their designated peak time (11 am - 1 pm). Besides my husband said it was dead when he went in to pick up - only one other customer there. So now... I can't eat my salad and I'm annoyed that no one will answer my call.,2-star,negative

I ordered a seasonal mediterranean salad. It was delightful! Everything tasted really fresh.

Will be back if I find myself in Scottsdale again.",5-star,positive
1202,cafes_list,"Mad greens is just a great, healthy alternative to the normal fast food fare. It's fast but healthy. I can only comment on the Ty Cobb salad because i love it so much, it's the only thing I ever order there. My daughters like it as well and the only reason for 4-star in that they do not have ketchup. Now, why would I want ketchup you may ask? Simple, my younger daughter gets their grilled cheese and likes to dip it in ketchup. I'd give a 4 1/2 if I could. This location and the others are all good got service too.

1203,cafes_list,"I ordered salads and hummus for my family thru Door Dash and I was very happy with the meals and the price. I would have given 5 stars but the citrus chicken was a little dry/overdone but still tasted very good. I had the Caesar and added the Mad Spice which was delicious. Garlicly with heat and if you like a little spice, I highly recommend. This salad is loaded with ad-ins. I finished my lettuce before I finished all the other goodies . . . no complaints here. The spicy avocado hummus was addictive. I just would have appreciated more than 1 pita. We also created a Greek like salad with chicken and it was very, very good. The port wine vinaigrette was delish. Almost a 5 star experience. Also the delivery with Door Dash was within 30 mins. Impressive. Very good experience. This will be on my routine rotation.",4-star,positive

My salad was flavorful and simple with baby greens, chicken, apples, goat cheese onions and egg. The girls were so nice and accommodating so close to closing time (I work in the industry and know how closing time is) you would've thought they just opened with how sweet they were!!

1225,cafes_list,"Meh, not that impressed. First time here and I had to mortgage my house to finance a cup of soup. $3.75 for an 8 oz cup of soup is a rip-off, in my opinion. I'd probably have to donate a kidney for a full bowl! For my entree I ordered the half Panini and side salad. They do give a generous portion of greens, along with nice chunks of avocado, which was nice, considering it was just a side salad. The grape tomatoes were fresh and super sweet. The dressing, while there was plenty of it, I found to be a little on the bland side. I believe it was a vinaigrette, but it could've used more vinegar. It was missing some zing. On to the panini. I got the MAD Cuban. The cashier indicated it was a good choice with his nod of approval. It was just ok. It could have used a little more ham and dijon. Overall, I'm not sure whether I'll be back or not. I think I could go either way. One thing is for sure: I won't be ordering soup again from here. I'd like to keep my house. PS - A note to all Scottsdale lunch eateries: Not everyone who spends time in Scottsdale is wealthy.

1228,cafes_list,"So... I totally ""milked"" the system. I work near their Tempe location, but live near this Scottsdale location, so on Free Salad Day, 25Jun15, I went to 1 location for lunch, and for dinner I went to this location. It was after 7pm, but there was still a line wrapped around the corner. There were water misters (my hair wasn't happy about that) blowing on the crowd to keep them cool and they also had flavored water dispensers to keep you hydrated in the heat. Employees were nice, helpful, and the free-day was a well-organized event. I ended up getting the same dish that I had at the other location, because I liked it so much. It was a veganized Don Quixote (and if ONE more person mispronounced his name in that line, I was gonna scream!): baby greens, Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu (instead of meat), roasted corn, avocado (with MAD spice), mango, green onions (instead of cheese), and the Roasted Red Pepper Dressing (instead of the non-vegan creamy ""something"" that came with it). I ended up saving it for lunch the next day, and I agree with the other Yelper about the wilting greens. It was definitely soupy the next day, but it had been swimming in dressing (plus, I requested a lot of dressing) 16 hours so I won't complain. Everything was still tasty the next day, and the avocados were still green (you know an avocado will turn on you quickly). VEGANS: For protein options, they have... 1 - Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu - These are chunks of firm tofu (with a slight squish factor), but the taste is excellent (and I am no tofu fan). I was told that they marinate their organic tofu for 24 hours; this is what gives it such great flavor. 2 - Grilled Portobellos (if mushrooms are your thang). 3 - Warm Quinoa. There are lots of fruits, veggies, and nuts as well. Avoid the Paninis! The bread is not vegan (their sourdough bread contains whey). VEGAN SALAD DRESSINGS - There is a print out by the dressings which shows you which ones are vegan. Note: if it says ""Vegan*"" -WITH an asterisk sign, that means the dressing has honey. Pure vegan dressings will not have the asterisk. I suggest checking out their online interactive ""allergen"" menu; you can click everything that you want to omit and they'll produce a qualifying list of items. You can then click on each to see exactly what ingredients are used. Know before you go! (The Balsamic Vinaigrette, Sherry Molasses Vinaigrette, and Roasted Red Pepper are among the pure vegan options.) Lastly, keep your eyes on your bowl as they add ingredients. I told the guy at the cash register that I was vegan so I'd be swapping non-vegan items for vegan items in my salad. I watched the girl and as soon as I saw her go for the cheese I started waving my hands profusely and saying, ""No, no NO!"" Too late. Cheese in the bowl. ""I told him vegan..."" I said with a sad face. She was like, ""No worries."" She tossed that bowl, told cashier-guy what he should add to the ticket for vegans, then she got me a brand new bowl and re-made my salad. No attitude. No bother. THAT was refreshing. I don't always want to eat a salad, but when I do, I'll think of MAD Greens!",5-star,positive

I've been going here once or twice a month for over a year and no one recognizes me (which isn't a big deal) Servers are friendly(sometimes),but most don't speak English very well so it makes it hard to order sometimes. Also make sure you sit close to the bar because once they give you your order they will not check on you to see how you are doing or even to just refill your drink and it can be hard to get someone's attention. I get the Awaze tibs which is beef and peppers. I would recommend this for anyone that isn't very adventurous with food but wants something delicious! I've tried other places but this is the best as far as food quality. Also food is cheap for how much you get. Great place for dates!!",3-star,negative
1232,cafes_list,"Dined here twice in the last week. Once with just me and the wife and once with the kids. Thought they would get a kick out of the 'eat with your hands' style. The food is quite tasty. We like spicy and they delivered on that quite well. It is a popular place and you will often see many cabs parked outside, but that's not necessarily because of tourists flocking there. It's mainly because of the high number of Ethiopian cab drivers that Las Vegas has. If you have never had Ethiopian food, served traditionally, keep in mind that it is served family style and with Injera used as the only food vessel/utensil. Injera is basically like a sour thin pancake/thick tortilla. We ordered the vegetable combo and meat combo. It is served on a big plate that is also covered in Injera. Like I said, the food is tasty and I strongly recommend it if you want to try authentic Ethiopian food. Now, the downsides: It is most certainly not the cleanest restaurant. Though the floor and tables appeared pretty clean, the walls, and fixtures are all quite dirty and dusty. Also, the bathrooms are borderline gross. The men's bathroom had no towels or toilet paper. The service is a bit slow and refills on water come once at best. Very friendly though. The restaurant is quite warm and they burn incense which is pretty potent. Also, the clientele is mainly Ethiopian so if you're not Ethiopian, be prepared to be stared at a bit by the clientele as you enter. Since you eat with your hands, I would expect a wet towel or something to rinse your hands with when you get there or when you are done, but neither are offered. Drinks are not served from a tap or soda fountain so no free refills on anything except ice water. Overall, I like the place and since we have been twice, I doubt we'll go back any time soon but I do recommend it if you're in the mood for a nice unique dining experience. Just be sure to wash your hands before you get there.",4-star,positive

The servers are nice- they smile to you and casually interact with you, unlike other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, where they can hardly speak English and they're difficult to be around.

The veggie combo - which we usually order at Ethiopian places - had something like 9 items on it!!! The service was friendly and accomodating if a little uneven.

He said, just dig in with your fingers. I lOvE that. Just EAT! The reason I went here is because Ty is Ethiopian. In the break room, the left overs were flavorful and great!! That one bite made me crave a new culture of food I couldn't believe I have never tried. Straight away I told my fiance, we're going to eat Ethiopian food. Soon. Ty told me which places were good in Vegas. He said this was the best food wise. Couple other's were good, one which has bad reviews on yelp.....but, because this was the best we went here! Sunday, just past 2pm. We drive into the ghetto strip mall (which I love when it comes to food). People are leaving from the establishment as we arrive. And.. we walk in. The place is empty. Well, there were two females one older and bitter, one younger and chipper... but the place was empty of customers. We choose a table with our son, get the high chair, and wait. And wait... and then we wait. I waaaved my hand, and we waited. Finally we got attention! YES! We can try authentic Ethiopian food!! This is what I wanted my fiance to try! She went to Hong Kong with me while she was pregnant and we still haven't had this fare. The 'waitress'? Comes over. We kind of know what to expect, but still have questions. Fiance orders the Salmon. I specifically ask what the difference is between their different lamb dishes. Response is, YES, you wont just the one fish? Fiance says YES! She points to the same Salmon dish on the menu. Answer is OK.....ok My turn, again. I ask for the lamb wot dish? Or more importantly please tell me what the different lamb dishes are... The description's look amazing. My taste buds are going crazy I just want to eat even though I have never in my life eaten in a place that has no customers!!!! (Seriously I don't think I have) Answer-Noooo.. just this one... 'server' pointing to the first lamb dish I pointed to... so.. OK I order that.. With confidence for sure. But then, the food comes. My dish comes first. The flavor of the sauce is exactly what my taste buds wanted to experience, but the substance. The delicious beef with bone stew flavor that they served me was what I expected Ethiopian food to be in flavor, but, it wasn't Lamb! What did I order? Lamb. Patti's dish comes...... LOL yeah, you think that's Salmon. She told the server the specific number on the menu of what she wanted. The server brought the fish the kitchen wanted to get rid of. My fiance is too kind to complain. We should have. The 'server' said ""TRY IT"" ""IT'S GOOOOD""... Patti said... yes... it is...... So she ate her white fish. but WOW. When I paid, the owner looking guy walked away when he heard me asking the question ""If I come again will you give us what we order""? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Think about this. When is the last time you have been to a 'restaurant' and been served something you didn't order. Entirely. And ate it. OK. The food was OK to eat. With the horrible taste in our mouth of being screwed over unfortunately. My dish just tasted like a nice Mexican beef stew that I'm cooking right now at home.

This dinning experience was actually the worst in my life. It's a zero star for sure.

1247,cafes_list,"We went there a few weeks ago and i forgot to write a review. I went with my foodie buddies, DJ and Jennilee, and my kids. My son is allergic to nuts and seafood and when i asked if they have that in their dishes, they couldn't understand so we had to buy food at 7-11 next door for him (which is fine for me because i'm used to that... but it may be inconvenient for others). I forgot the names of the things we tried but i remember what they were. the first dish was an appetizer described as a spicy lentils in a puff pastry. it was delicious! But fair warning, the red sauce that comes with it has kick. Next we had the veggie platter, it is HUGE the size of a large pizza with the sour tasting, foam looking ""pita bread"" that is used as your utensils. It had some hummus-looking portions around the platter and as well as salad, lentils, and other Indian-like dishes that you scoop up with your sponge bread. All of them were tasty but i got sick of the sponge bread because of the sourness. We also ordered a dish with spicy red sauce and 1 chicken leg and 1 egg. it was pretty good. Then we ordered a beef cube dish and it was super good--no sauce, just seasoned meat. it was a good experience but i don't think i would go back again. except maybe for that puff pastry :)",3-star,negative
1248,cafes_list,"Awesome food! I don't have anything other Ethiopian spots to reference this place against but I'm surely convinced that this spot is the jams! We opted for the Vegetarian platter. A whole plate of Ethiopian dishes (none of which I remember, but the orange one is awesome!) smattered on Ethiopian bread and super tasty. The fun part about it is that I used my hands and the bread to eat the whole time; no utensils required. Also, the same night we went, they decided to have a coffee ceremony and asked us if we would like to have a complimentary cup. After little debate, we agreed to try some coffee. It did take a while (like 30 minutes) but the coffee was awesome! Light and tasty is how I remembered it. Definitely something to try if you ever get a chance to stop in. It is in a crappy neighborhood but don't let that scare you off. Good food and good coffee and definitely a good time.",5-star,positive
1249,cafes_list,"I was pretty excited about eating here as I've only been to one other Ethiopian restaurant in my life. It was in NYC and terrible. So after seeing all the reviews here, I definitely wanted to try this out. I ordered the awaze lamb tips, which the waitress tells me is the spicy version of the lamb tip dish. And I order the dark version of their Ethiopian beer. The beer isn't bad. I decide to try the light version and did not like it. And honestly, the dark beer really isn't true dark beer. Give it a try. My plate comes out on a plate but on top of bread plate. I was really excited after seeing the waitress bring out this enormous plate for another table with tons of food on the same bread. The bread is spongy and cold! I was a little shocked at the bread being cold. I've eaten at a lot ethnic places that uses bread plate and it's typically served warm to hot. This was the 1st time I've had it cold. So obviously, you don't get any utensils to eat with your meal. My lamb was really tough which definitely took away from my experience. And I kept on thinking that the meal would have tasted better if the bread had been warm instead of cold-but what do I know? I guess this is the culture. Here's the thing that made me not give this place a 2 star rating. It's really, really fun to eat with your hands. It really made me want to go back and try the other foods. So hopefully I'll have an update in the future for this place and raise my rating.",3-star,negative
1250,cafes_list,"Located in a run down strip mall off the strip, it's nondescript exterior does little to advertise the amazing restaurant located inside. I discovered this place years ago on one of the many business trips I make to Vegas every year. A friend and I were hungry, and looking for a place to eat near by our hotel. We just looked for restaurants in his cars GPS, and to my surprise there was an Ethiopian place near by! I often eat at one of the many excellent Ethiopian restaurants in Los Angeles, but had never seen one in Vegas.... Until that faithful day. If you like hole in the wall type places that offer excellent ethnic food, this place will not disappoint. I've eaten here about 8 times now, and have yet to have a bad meal. All of the Ethiopian staples are here. The injera (a type of sour spongy flat bread) is perfectly prepared with just the right bite, and a fluffy yet chewy texture. The tibs and wat (beef or lamb) are both beautifully spiced and prepared. The Doro wat (chicken stew with egg) is also excellent. The little salad that is served with all meals has a nice dressing, and a little tomato for added sweetness. All of the vegetarian options are available as well, and are just as good. Today I had the pleasure of sampling their Ethiopian coffee! Perfect. Strong and sweet, with no milk. They prepare it in a special kettle by hand on a small range / open fire right in the middle of the restaurant. (not in the back kitchen) I hadn't planned on ordering it, and I wasn't even quite sure what it was the lady was preparing at first. It looked interesting, as it is appeared to be quite an involved process. I asked what she was preparing, and she was happy to explain to me that she was making coffee, and was kind enough to offer me a cup. It was so good! I'm a fan of Cuban coffee, but this gives it a run for it's money. At the end of the meal, I wasn't even charged for it. The Portions are huge, and the prices are very reasonable. A meal with soda clocks in at about 10 bucks with tax, and you'll probably have some left overs. The service has always been friendly, and prompt. It's a really special place, that definitely caters to the local Ethiopian population. You'll often see local cab drivers on their breaks eating a quick bite, or Ethiopian ladies gossiping or discussing the days news over coffee. It's a very authentic experience, which is often hard to find in Las Vegas. Don't let the neighborhood or exterior scare you away, an excellent experience awaits you inside!",5-star,positive
1251,cafes_list,"As a former vegatarian (and now a dirty, dirty carnivore), I can say I've eaten a lot of Ethiopian food during my life. And, this place ranks high. It's located in an unglamorous, partially deserted stripmall (like most delicious LV restaurants). And then you walk in....and...okay, not glamorous inside either. Don't even go into the bathroom, trust me, you will be frightened. But the food, the food. I always order the vegetarian combo (some habits die hard) and at least one meat option. The vegetarian combo has a great selection of dishes that includes cabbage, pureed vegetables, lentils and a salad. My favorite meat dishes are the lamb tibs, gored gored, and Kitfo. The lamb tibs and gored gored (cubed, cooked beef) are all marinated and served in delicious sauces. Do try the house Kitfo, the raw ground beef. It may sound scary but it's really just ethiopian steak tartare (I told you i'm a really dirty carnivore now). Between two people, two entrees is wayyy more than enough to order. All the entrees average from $8-$10 and everything is served on injera(the big, bread pancake). Also, if you don't know, eat with your right hand and use the extra injera bread as your utensils. Please note that service here is at a ""leisurely pace."" Be prepared for an extended dinner as the waitresses, while super nice and pseudo attentive, are generally very busy and take a while to bring you the check.",4-star,positive
1252,cafes_list,"I almost always get the vegetarian platter because it's delicious, cheap, has a ton of variety, and is composed of different dishes every time I go. One veggie platter serves two (leaving you either stuffed or with lefotvers), and coupled with two sodas puts you out under $12 (just add in tip). Just a tip, either accept eating with your hands, or remember that silverware is BYO. The veggie platters come with about six dishes, always one or two lentils, a split pea (yellow), some kind of green, often either cabbage or beets, a salad (seasoned with a vinagrette, sometimes spicy, sometimes not), sometimes green beans, and one or two other legume based things that are usually unidentifiable and delicious. I love Ethiopian dishes, they are so warm, savory, and spicy - with complex flavors (I wouldn't even know where to start to imitate it at home), and the tangy, yeasty injera (spongy crepe-like bread) rocks my world. My favorites on the veggie platter are always lentils, split peas, anything involving the cooked cabbage (often coupled with potatoes and carrots), greens (sometimes collards, sometimes others, generally finely chopped and stewed until delicious), and anything involving beets (also generally coupled with potatoes). You don't get a choice for what comes on the veggie platter, just whatever they happen to be cooking up in the kitchen that day. I don't think I've ever eaten the same meal twice. Expect the food to be plentiful and diverse, and the service to be friendly and slow (don't expect to be in and out of there in under an hour, and expect to have to ask for your check, and then maybe take it to the front to pay). If you're even a slightly adventurous eater, like a lot of flavor to your meal and bang for your buck, Merkato should be on your ""to do"" list.",5-star,positive
1253,cafes_list,"I work near Merkato and end up going there for lunch at least a few times every month. This place is exactly what I expect and want from Ethiopian dining: quiet, delicious, large portions, and cheap. The wait staff is always very friendly, helpful, and accommodating, and the food quality has never disappointed. I've never had any of the meat selections, but the variety in the vegetarian combination platter is more than enough for two people and it is always diverse! In addition, some of the items in the vegetarian combination platter change around on a regular basis which makes it more interesting if you plan to come back (and, if you are dining with others, it makes for fun conversations/debates about which items are best). It is, however, a very slow-paced (but relaxing!) atmosphere, so I wouldn't recommend going to Merkato if you have less than an hour available.",5-star,positive
1254,cafes_list,"This was my first go at eating Ethiopian food and I really enjoyed it. The food did not look very appetizing but it was quite tasty, and fun...see, you eat with your hands. We were with another friend who had been here quite a few times before and she knew her way around the menu, so she ordered for us with a little help from our waitress. I honestly have no idea what we ate, but it was all good. It wasn't spicy but from what I understand we could have ordered our main dishes a tad bit more on the spicy side, had we not been novices. The service was a little lacking considering we were the only people in the place but the wait staff was nice enough. It seems like this place is mostly a place for Ethiopians now living in Vegas to come hang out, listen to music, smoke, drink and just visit. There is a little stage with a microphone in the cafe that I suppose is utilized on the weekends with live music. By the time we left, the place was full and we were the only non Ethiopians in the whole place. I will go back the next time I'm in Vegas. It was super cheap. ..$30 for three of us and we ordered WAY too much food. We could have ordered about 1/3 less and still walked away fat and happy.",3-star,negative
1255,cafes_list,"If you enjoy having Ethiopian food, you'll really enjoy visiting Merkato. (This means you already know you won't get any utensils, and you'll be eating by tearing pieces of injera off and wrapping your food in it.) If you're into fancy places with three sets of forks, spoons, and knives, you should move along: there's nothing to see here. Jon A. and I took the 203 bus from the Strip to visit Merkato for dinner on a Saturday night. Our waitress was happy to answer our questions (e.g., ""We want a lamb entree, but which one would you recommend?""). We went all out and ordered three drinks: mango juice ($2) and two helpings of spiced tea ($1 each). The mango juice isn't fresh-squeezed; it's in a glass bottle and imported from somewhere. But it was delicious. And the spiced tea really hit the spot on this cold evening. It was regular ol' Lipton tea, but they'd added warm spices to the hot water used to steep the teabag in. We ended up with the house kitfo ($10) and awaze lamb tibs ($8.50) based on our waitress's recommendations. Our entrees came on the same big plate with three sides in total: a salad, goat feta cheese, and stewed spinach. Even though we tried our best to stuff ourselves silly, we still couldn't finish everything, which was saddening to me because we had no fridge back at the hotel to preserve the leftovers in. If I had to order all over again, I would have voted to order one meat entree and one vegetarian one: two meat entrees felt like a ton of meat for the two of us. (But it was very tasty.) During the meal, a guy at another table showed off his ability to balance a chair on his chin at two different times. There's also a dance floor and stage off to the side: they probably have special events and musicians visit once in a while. The atmosphere was laid back and friendly, which I really appreciated. When we were getting ready to go, we asked our waitress if she knew where the return bus stop was. Not only did she tell us where to go, but she also dug through her bag to look up the bus schedule for us. How sweet is that? The verdict: Huge and delicious portions, sincerely friendly service, and very reasonable prices. I'm a fan of Merkato! Extra hint: They have a coupon for buy one entree, get one 1/2 off until February 28 this year. (Maybe they'll have another offer on their website after that.) I did have to remind the waitress to apply it after she handed us the first draft of our bill, but she was apologetic and promptly fixed the mistake.",5-star,positive
1256,cafes_list,Ok. I don't know squat about Ethiopian food but being the gallant food adventurer that I am I soldiered into this place twice to place an order. I think I need to try this place a few more times and further educate myself before I can write an accurate review but it is so unique others should know about this restaurant.

1258,cafes_list,"I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER. that is right. it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice. just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer. now, you might be thinking, ""Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?"" and to that I say, ""Fuck you."" So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege. It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat. Delicious. While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, ""HIGH FIVE!"" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear. HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, ""faux chicken chow mein."" Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, ""Because this one's a VEGAN! Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed. Good one, you guys! It IS hilarious when someone is vegan! HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR. we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed. GODDAMMIT. we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular. We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets. Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I ""forgot"" mine, you dig? I ain't paying when money bags is around! I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up. Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW! and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET! do you think it comes in pink?? We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato. The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening. You're saying to yourself, ""Who gives a fuck, Laura?"" And to that I say, ""Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."" We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded. Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness. I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT. One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT. my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle. now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan. i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat. tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef. i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi. ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment. So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia. Slowly. But friendly. Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip. MY DAD'S BAD! we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, ""hold on"" and disappears. two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel. Major bonus. In the end, we're dealing with: Cab rides: $135. Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea) Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200. So anyway, I think we still did good. And there's a cab driver (Yasin! Holla!) who is high rolling tonight. Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country. As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight! I love my dad. I am finally done, you can rest your eyes. Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.",5-star,positive

Their roll cake is amazing, the sponge part of the cake is always fresh because they make it every day freshly, they have green tea, chocolate, and probably vanilla. The most memorable flavor is chocolate, it has chocolate chunks and chocolate mousse/cream inside the cake, and the chocolate they uses aren't something low quality; the vanilla one has mochi in it, it gives an interesting texture; the green tea is green tea.

1281,cafes_list,"Overall - 3.5/5.0 Open concept coffee bar serving up Japanese influenced lattes, cookies and cake rolls. Service was great as you would expect from many Japanese establishments. Liked the texture of their matcha latte but could have definitely been more potent in flavour. Cakes are moist but pretty standard for the most part. Would like to have seen more intricacies with their desserts but I think the simplicity in their menu works fine for most folks. Great place to chill or study (if you can find a vacant table).",3-star,negative

I've been here a few times and have enjoyed whatever I got every time. the rolls are definitely and must try. they aren't too sweet, just enough sweetness. can't wait to come during spring/summer when they have seasonal flavoured rolls love the look of this place as all",5-star,positive
1283,cafes_list,"I'd been stalking this place on Insta for a while now, and happened to be in the neighborhood today. The shop is super cute, lots of good seating and extra high ceilings. The Japanese hipster staff is adorable, and super friendly. The music is on point. But the coffee was lukewarm. I had an Americano, and the barista asked me to say when on the water, but then poured so fast it killed all the crema and didn't give me a chance to say when. I have no idea who would need that much water that quickly. So I was then SHOCKED when I sipped and found the coffee not nearly hot enough. It tasted ok, definitely some good beans in play. But just not hot enough. I had also been excited to try the roll cake, but in person it looked a little dry, not nearly as appealing as the roll cake at Petit Nuage - so I skipped it. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",3-star,negative

1286,cafes_list,"Arrived on a weekday morning to a mostly empty cafe - only two tables at the front occupied (perhaps because the set up of a small table is not super friendly to freelancers?) This quaint little cafe is located next to the George Brown campus, with modern minimalist decor. Front of cafe seating is all single tables and back of cafe seating is more friendly for catching up with friends. I came by mostly to try the matcha red bean roll cake - being a big fan of both, and of course the slush drink commonly found at bubble tea cafes, I was curious to see how the dessert equivalent was executed. Verdict? Not so sweet which I liked, but the matcha flavour was a little lacking and there was very little red bean to add to the flavour combo. The service was mostly friendly, the barista/owner suggested an SprOld Fashioned to my friend (think the cocktail with espresso substitute for the liquor) and a Lovely Latte for myself (don't be fooled by the name, this is just a regular, no frills latte). My friend thought his drink was interesting,and I thought my drink was a little weak on the espresso. Total for two roll cakes and two drinks with tax+tip came out to just under $20. Overall, the cafe is a lovely addition to the neighbourhood and the roll cakes are definitely worth a try if you're not into super sweet dessert, but execution lacked especially on the drinks. I will likely go back to Fahrenheit nearby for coffee unless Asian dessert cravings call.",3-star,negative
1287,cafes_list,"Really nice new space for a neighborhood cafe. The flat white I tried was good, as was the choux pastry I tried, though echoing another reviewer, not mind-blowing.

It's a nice mellow spot to check out if you're in the neighborhood .",3-star,negative
1288,cafes_list,"Excited that we have a new coffee place in the hood. Came in bright and early in the morning to welcome them to the hood. They were quite indifferent. No smiles. Asked for recommendations and got a sigh with an under the breath response of ""Matcha Aduki"" said he has already said it a million times. Tried it as I can be too quick to judge. The verdict is in. London fog was weak. Matcha Aduki weak. Bland flavours for both and for the price and service I am going to stick to my regular spot.

The menu is insanely reasonably priced up and down, and they have a rotating list of specials on the board.

Full of flavour and perfectly balanced with cheese and sauces, i was STUFFED for $9. My girlfriend got a scrambled egg sandwich that was on special and she was jaw dropped. Blown away! The bacon was the tastiest she's ever tried. All in all, really great meal. Recommend to anyone, won't disappoint.",5-star,positive
1293,cafes_list,"Came here based on the high reviews and left thinking this place either used to be really good and went downhill or manipulated their Yelp rating with fake reviews because when comparing this place to others in the general area, it doesn't make sense to ever come here. I ordered an iced latte and huevos rancheros with hash browns. The latte was almost undrinkable - it tasted like cold drop coffee mixed with milk. The highlight was the huevos rancheros which were actually pretty good - hence two stars in this review. However, I asked for hash browns as a side and what I received were thinly cut french fries that were subpar at best. I asked about a possible mistake on getting fries and the server mentioned that these french fries were, indeed, their ""hash browns""... I think the people running this place should probably check out google images on what exactly hash browns are or change their side choices from large French fries (the other option) to ""small French fries"". Overall, a disappointment - especially when Butters, Altitude Coffee, and Village coffee are literally right down the street.",2-star,negative

1308,cafes_list,Noci is a nice neighborhood cafe. As you walk in they have pastries at a counter to the right and you can grab one and a coffee to go. I decided to sit at a table inside and have a full breakfast. The place was pretty busy. Definitely quite a few old guys who are regulars sitting around drinking coffee and BSing with each other which is cool. The owners and staff really hustle and provide good service. I had the sausage and cheese omelet with hash browns. The omelet itself was pretty basic but good sized. The hash browns were a little dry and crispy more like matchstick potatoes and I wasn't wild about them. Overall I'd say this is a pretty good place for breakfast if you're in the area.,4-star,positive

Their lattes are absolutely amazing, as is the fresh squeezed orange juice they sell.

Lots of plugins here and free wifi! Though it's pretty busy and noisy so not very good to get work done unless you can tune out noise.

I love the Marda Loop location, and I love that they do a Holt pop up so I can have them while I work too. But on a few recent visits to the Chinook location, I've been rethinking about this love affair. Let's break down the points: -I have yet to have a stellar cup of coffee that didn't taste.........burnt. -I appreciate the time the barista takes to make a latte leaf.....but in the rush of things it usually looks like the abstract version of the norm. -They are constantly out of grilled cheese around dinner time. -Why serve salad if it's going to be one bite worth, crammed in a ketchup cup? -Why is the front cash girl so grumpy? (Maybe this is specific to me, maybe she hates me). One thing that is completely out of their control: STROLLERS. omg it's crowded enough as it is in that small space, why are there so many strollers?! Getting nipped in the ankle by some angry mother is bad enough as it is, it's like this place is a trap for angry moms to take their anger out on people. I will endorse the business philosophy and the ideological vessel that makes this business a great success, but I really can't deal with another visit to this location. Too much disappointment here.

I will admit that I'm usually pretty put off by most chain style shops where their joe tends to taste more like battery acid or water dressed in brown. P & S breaks that conception. Their coffee is rich and complex, their selection reads like a sommelier's wine list, which is as it should be. Selling coffee by ""light"" ""medium"" and ""dark"" is like categorizing wine using only white or red.

Not that I understood everything, but he seemed really into the coffee which got me really jazzed. First time I heard the named-after-those-cool-calgarian-dudes name of the cafe I thought: Disney.

Phil & Sebastian so far is the best coffee I've found in Calgary. These guys clearly are from the Third Wave Coffee ilk and uphold that tradition with excellence. My first experience with P&S was at the Calgary Farmer's Market and from that point it was clear that these guys knew what they were doing. Let's do the technical details run down: - Locally roasted coffee beans: Check. They have their own roaster in Calgary - Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso Check.

I have also tried one of their infamous lattes, and they use my favourite kind of soymilk, the texture of the soy lending itself well to latte art. Not too long ago, I stopped in with a friend, and she purchased me a cup of tea. I was happy to see that they were using an actual steeping device with loose leaf, like many other specialty tea shops use for tea to go. I personally am not a fan of these devices as they are plastic, and often carelessly cleaned at establishments I've seen in the past. However, my tea came out tasting okay, and it was worth waiting a couple minutes as opposed to being served bagged tea. I would rather be sipping on said tea while shopping for potatoes and brussel sprouts at the aforementioed old farmer's market than Chinook Mall, but I guess I can consider this a place to hide and read if I am ever dragged to Chinook.

The original location at the Calgary Farmers Market remains my favourite - it was so inconspicuously delicious. This location is also awesome - next to Sears on the North Side of the new expansion at Chinook Mall. Have you seen the new expansion? It is rather fabulous. Armani, Michael Kors, Kiehl's, Judith & Charles to name a few. P&S fits in perfectly with high-end latte art and five-star clover coffee. * Free Parking, and easy access for commuters * Lots of Seats, a very comfortable cafe experience * Free WiFi, the password is usually an 8 syllable coffee name, just ask :) * Groovy Staff * Don't get me started on the coffee...

And until recently I would have put the third-wave coffee movement and your atypical super mall. That was until I went to the newest Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters buried deep within Chinook Centre. This new P&S location is the same great coffee you expect from their previous two locations (in Marda Loop & The Farmers Market), but with an interesting twist. Well it's not really a twist, but rather a different philosophy which makes this coffee shop such a hidden gem. Most shopping centre coffee shops are designed to churn out a steady stream of customers. You know get you on your way as navigate the treacherous halls. But, P&S is the opposite. It's main focus is the coffee and the coffee experience. A brewed cup takes about 3 minutes to brew and after a busy afternoon of shopping, the mandatory break is a welcomed relief from the constant stress of shopping. This is a really treat and if you're already a fan of the other shops, you're going to love this. I know it's a mandatory stop for me whenever I visit Chinook now.",5-star,positive

The coffee takes a little longer than usual, but that is because it's better - they brew it by the cup, so it's not your usual drip coffee, and their lattes are amazing as well. I especially recommend the Manjari Mocha - it's not too sweet, but has the most amazing chocolately aftertaste. And the grilled cheese is a must-have, it's the cheapest sandwich there but also my favourite. The staff is also fantastic, super nice and remember customer faces!

The hand pies are just average for the high price and any specialty drinks they might be able to make are obscured by the lack of clear menu/visuals. I stayed at the hotel last night, came here his morning, then went to Colectivo for a masala chai and pastry. I ordered the blueberry pie, which seemed to have a filling reminiscent or curdled milk, but was ricotta once. Threw it out. On the way back to the hotel, I saw they had a sandwich board outside advertising a specialty coffee drink, which I never saw inside or would have started there.",2-star,negative

1351,cafes_list,"I wish Portage Pi took advantage of the charming space they have, because they could easily be the coolest coffee shop in town with some improvements in service and quality of products. I went around 9am on a weekday morning to get some work done. The other reviews are correct in saying students use this coffee shop as a study spot. PP seems to encourage it by offering payment with Badger Cash and a printing station that I noticed multiple students use. I also saw multiple students leave and return to bring in sandwiches from Collectivo. Maybe they have an aversion to the savory pies that are served by this establishment? I ordered a regular drip coffee along with a veggie pi. The coffee came out right away after I found a seat at the long wooden table in the middle of the room. Nice touch with the plethora of outlets. I waited 10 minutes for the veggie pi and when I asked about it, the barista said she forgot. Then, it came out REALLY hot. Food does not seem to be their strong point, judging by the other items available. The pie did taste decent. One thing that really caught me off guard when I first arrived was the lack of clarity in their menu. They have a paper menu, a chalkboard, and a letter menu hanging behind the coffee bar, all with different levels of detail. The paper menu seemed to be the most comprehensive, but still didn't have many items on it. I kept looking for common espresso drinks and couldn't find any other than the ""bonfire mocha,"" which was the special. Looking online, it looks like they do have those on a separate page, although the online menu is also askew with it showing up incorrectly (double side-by-side). This place is worth a stroll through to check out the cute interiors, but there are better places to get coffee mere steps away.",3-star,negative

Portage also seems to be a popular study spot, with a long, narrow table in the middle of the cafe with plenty of outlets and good lighting.

I liked my Wisconsin Pi (cheese curds, ham, egg) but my roommate wasn't crazy about her short rib pi. Thought my smoothie was great. My real gripe is the price. $6 for a smoothie and $6 for a very small pie. I think they could make the pies a little bigger and then I would be happy to pay the money.

1365,cafes_list,"I have always wanted to try Portland Variety, and last week I finally made the plunge. It was rather quiet but it was on a weeknight with winterlicious still going on (they did not participate), so reservations were not really necessary. The decor spells ""business casual"", but I was perfectly comfortable wearing casual clothing. The drinks are on the pricier side and they are definitely asking for too much for wines by the bottle. Fortunately for me the beer there is priced reasonably, and there was a good IPA on tap. Our server informed us that the dishes are meant to be shared, and are on the smaller side. Since the price of these items are priced like a regular entree, I feel that they are asking for a few dollars too much. We decided to order 4 dishes for the two of us. We shared a Winter Greens salad, which tasted fine until I noticed that there were pomegranate seeds in it (not listed as an ingredient on the menu), which gave a very unplesant crunch with the angel hair collard greens. The eggplant byaldi was just ok, there was nothing special about it. We then had the whole cornish hen, which came with piri piri sauce. We thought the hen was done well and tasted good, and liked the veggies and farro that accompanied it. The grilled octopus was also done well and had a spicy kick to it, perhaps too much. I was pleased that is was not over-done and was very tender. During our meal, a person working in the kitchen (I am guessing the head chef) decided to yell at one of the line cooks for not being on top of their game/not paying attention/..something. There were quite a bit of expletives and me and my friend thought it was quite unprofessional. This went on for a good 5 minutes and it interrupted our conversation and made us uncomfortable. The server was nervously looking at our direction and definitely know we are hearing all of it. All in all, despite having an ok cornish hen and octopus dish, Portland variety did not win me over and I don't feel it is worth the price. The two of us had one drink each and 4 dishes and the bill came to $140 (tax, tip included). If it was around $120 it would have been more reasonable (and really, they should have thrown in the drinks for the drama we had to listen to). Meh",2-star,negative
1366,cafes_list,"Friday night. Four friends. Reservations made but not necessary. We were all very very impressed with the service. Two servers for our table which made us feel almost vip.

I will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu and their cocktails. The ambiance is very cozy and romantic. Great place to take your date or chill at the beautiful marble bar with friends. Well decorated and layed out. Drinks: Try the Silk Oak 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon - smooth, bold and great with the type of hearty food served. Also try the hibiscus beer and the pumpkin one. For someone who doesn't drink beer, I was very impressed. My new favourite. Crochettes - deep fried goodness melted in your mouth, just perfect. Patas bravas - who knew potatoes could be so exciting. Sourdough bread - grilled pieces as well as soft sourdough bread alongside soft butter. Mushroom salad - light and full of flavour with a few types of fancy mushrooms, arugala and cheese shavings. Porchetta (if you like pork) - crispy skin, some fat. I wasn't a fan but I usually only eat bacon and pork belly. Eggplant dish - had a fantastic tomatoe sauce with some cinnamon, giving it a distinct flavor of awesomeness. Burnt cheesecake - it's cheesecake! Can't go wrong :)",5-star,positive

If you've never had cassava fries before, they taste like a sweeter potato fry but not as sweet as sweet potato fries. Here, they are prepared crunchy and salty served with an aioli sauce. I also thought the cheese plate was good and had pickled grapes, very interesting. It's in a hipster part of town, walking distance to my favorite cocktail spot Spirit House.

1374,cafes_list,"This place is more of a scene than a food haven. We arrived at around 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning and grabbed a quick bite from the cafe located at the front of the restaurant. Overall, while the decor is definitely stylish and ambiance is trendy (plus, prime for people-watching), the food is just average. Like, I wouldn't come back here if I wanted a meal to blow my mind, but I'd come back to sit and enjoy the King West vibe. We ordered a smoked salmon bagel ($8), a croissant ($2.55), a coffee, and a tea. The bagel wasn't anything special; the croissant was light and buttery, but wasn't the best I've had. The food also wasn't as fresh as it could be. The coffee tasted like an average brew (but it's bottomless, so that's a plus), but the tea was nice and comforting. For two people, we paid around $15.90 at the cafe. The food doesn't equal the best value, but I guess when you're paying for the scene, food isn't at the top of the priority list. Overall, we enjoyed the vibe here, but we'd go somewhere else if we specifically want a tasty breakfast. Also, come early if you're come for the sit-down brunch.

1379,cafes_list,"I freakin' love Portland Variety. Great food, gorgeous decor and sweet staff. First off, the decor is one of the prettiest in Toronto (in my opinion). Think marble counters, a mix of wood & marble top tables, a skylight, and whimsical chalkboard drawings. It's airy looking but still cozy feeling. At the front of house, they have a great variety of tasty takeaway baked goods (cookies, croissants, etc) and readymade food (yogurt, sandwiches, salads, etc) & coffee drinks. Their espresso is one of my favourites in the city - I usually order a latte. Also, points for having decaf! If you get one thing from Portland Variety, make it a chocolate chip cookie. You will have dreams about it later on and may struggle to contain your foodgasm in public (I speak from experience). As far as breakfast goes, I've had the bacon egg cheddar croissant and the breakfast burrito with egg, monterey jack, homemade chorizo & salsa. Both were fantastic. The bacon egg cheddar croissant is buttery, flaky, fluffy.. basically everything I've dreamed of a croissant sandwich being. If you're looking for something with a little kick, I recommend going for the breakfast burrito.

I can't even comment on the quality of the food... because I didn't have any, so this comment is solely for the service and experience. My friend and I popped in here on a Friday night because we were actually just waiting for a table at a different restaurant down the street. While we had no intentions of having a full on meal here, we decided to grab some cocktails and maybe some small snacks. We were basically ignored when we walked in, one waiter waved at us and said someone would be with us shortly, but we stood around waiting for close to 10 minutes before another person even acknowledged our presence. I glanced around as the waitress led us in, and the place wasn't even full, there were tons of empty tables available at around 6 PM. We were seated at a table for two in the back corner and given menus to look at... then basically left alone for another 20 minutes. No one came to introduce ourselves, no one came to take our orders, no one even came to fill our water glasses. We couldn't wave down anyone's attention, and there were employees just standing around not doing anything, so I didn't really understand what was going on. FINALLY, after my friend and I decided to stop chatting to each other and just put on the bitchiest faces while looking around, a waitress came by and we ordered our drinks. Skipped out on snacks because we were scared that we would have to wait another 30 mins. Our drinks did come fairly quickly after we ordered, so I will give the restaurant credit for that. However, soon afterwards my friend and I had to leave, so then came the struggle of getting the bill. Our waitress was busy washing dishes or something, and wouldn't even look up at us. Soon afterwards she disappeared out onto the patio and then was basically never seen again. Other waiters in the restaurant saw us clearly waving and trying to grab her attention and just chose to go about their business and completely ignore us! It was ridiculous - pretty much the vibe there seems to be: just serve your own assigned tables and ignore everyone else. Honestly, most frustrating experience ever.

Snacks, hipster music and staff, great spirits, passable beer, and more than enough in the general atmosphere to make up for a somewhat unexpectedly limited wine list. I'll start with some of the cons. As I alluded above, the wine list isn't great. And I don't expect a casual snack bar to have a long list of stunners. But offer some neat stuff by the glass, at least. More than two or three, and more than almost exclusively VQA pours. It doesn't make sense with the rest of the cosmopolitan menu. Additionally, I really wanted to order from the snack menu at lunch and wasn't able to. I've had Ibérico before and really wanted to see how they presented it, and was disappointed to hear I could only order from the lunch menu. But I got past it. I had the warm mushroom and arugula salad with added seared hen. The salad was terrific and I wasn't expecting it to be. It was curiously arranged, with all the mushrooms and dressing buried underneath a pile of arugula and pinenuts. At first I thought this amounted to poor presentation, but it actually made sense. The arugula stayed fresh, vital, and crisp by not warming up, and this contrasted and paired perfectly with delicious warm, assorted mushrooms, accented nicely by a soy-based dressing and the sharp manchego. The hen was a little dry, but Portland made up for that with a nice accompanying sauce, spicy and tangy. It was served incredibly quickly which means that the hen is pre-cooked, but I understand that. I drank a Cafe Biscotti to start, then had a nice bottle of Italian beer, Collesi. The former was a nice warm-up after an enormous windy blizzard, and the latter was a great, dry friend to accompany my book and light lunch. Both were very nice and unique. The decor and atmosphere of the place is definitely great. Light hipster music playing softly, like Cults or Passion Pit, with a beautiful white marble bar and bright natural lighting contrasting mostly black furniture. Very modern, very cool. I would recommend it to anyone as a casual hangout, and I assume it would be even better if you could share a few snack menu items.",4-star,positive

1389,cafes_list,"I'm sure some fans of this place will immediately see the two star rating I've given it and gasp (and I was considering one star), however I'm basing this rating on the one thing that I walked in for, that being espresso. I had ten minutes to kill at work, so after consulting Yelp for the closest cafe, I walked down the street to Reba's to get a shot. It looked promising online, boasting organic fair trade beans. Upon walking in, my eyes scanned the bar and my immediate reaction was to retrace my steps out the door when I saw the home (as in not professional) espresso machine. I didn't have time to go back to work and search out another cafe in this unfamiliar neighbourhood, so I decided to bear it, but not without suggesting first to the ""barista"" that the shop really needed to upgrade their machine as they weren't doing their lovely selection of beans any justice. His response was ""you'd be surprised"". I asked for a double shot. He loaded it up, ran a shot and was about to run a second blast of water through the same head with the same used grinds (ummm) when I quickly stopped him and said ""no, no, that will be fine"". As any other espresso aficionado may have guessed, I was NOT surprised. As not to be insulting (I could have pulled a Badalamenti, Mulholland drive performance http://movieclips.com/y5A6-mulholland-dr-movie-bad-coffee/ ) I drank my glorified drip coffee and paid up with another ""cafe"" crossed off in my mental notebook. If you're looking for a good shot, look elsewhere. It's a shame that this place has to do so poorly in this area because everything else seemed great about it. The food looked good, the wholesale beans looked good, the rooms looked good (the reasons I gave two stars instead of one). The bottom line is that If you're going to have the word ""cafe"" in your name (a European term, and in Europe coffee=espresso) then I think you should have your espresso game honed.

I also like that they give you a little bown of vegetable crisps on the side - completely random, but a nice touch. My Americano was very rich and flavour and not at all bitter.

A dog owner is suitable really because this little cafe has a lazy dog sort of attitude that's easy to fall in love with. They serve all sorts of sweet treats (including these FANTASTIC squares that are clustery-gooey-nutty and delicious), coffee, tea and sandwiches. Actually, while I was there (drinking my chamomile tea out of a big mason jar mug) three regular customers stopped in for bagel sandwiches that looked super tasty. The casual atmosphere, rather than the coldness of a Starbucks, allowed for easy conversation. The cafe also has a back room which has housed book launches, readings, and music shows, with many more plans in the works. The cafe also exhibits art work from local artists. Oh, and free WiFi.

I think the people are nice etc. and have no problem with it at all. Here's the thing. I think we all have a responsibility to right wrongs in this world. If any one of us is slighted, we are all slighted. If any one of us turns a head on injustice, we all suffer and our world becomes something less. So much of the time we're just lost. We say, ""Please, God. Tell us what is right. Tell us what is true."" And there is no justice. The rich win. The poor are powerless. Anyway I went to this place and asked to speak to the owner. Sir. I said it to him. Sir. I have a hypothetical for you. He was confused but I kept on going. I wanted to see if he had changed his ways. I wanted to know if he had learned a harsh lesson from the caustic words of a reasonably literate former important customer. Sir. What would you do today if one of your customers, an oenophile say, with a business nearby, a coffee drinker who even brings guests here to drink coffee, lets say he has some employees. And one day, without warning one of this important guy's scrofulous employees rolls in, bypasses the restaurant altogehter, goes into your restroom and bombs the place with a day-old percolated black coffee and steak bowel movement that brings tears to your perky servers' eyes? What then, sir? Do you say anything when he of an altered gait moves reluctantly back out into the world? Without buying a coffee. What do you do? He is deeply troubled by the question, ""Uh. Nothing?"" So far so good. And what about the next time the important man comes in and buys a coffee? Do you comment on the pipe-rattling shit his ragtag employee left wallowing paperless in the stall nearest the door, steam on the mirror? Do you, sir, say anything? Did I mention that this important man can use the internet and can access dozens of quotations and lyrics with a flourish of his keyboard? A renaissance man. ""What would I say? Nothing I guess."" Perhaps he has guessed right. Perhaps he has learned. Good enough for me. Four star review avoided. We beat on. Boats against the current...",5-star,positive

1409,cafes_list,"I like the concept of this place but there's so much room for improvements. You don't have to pay a cover to get in, you just have to buy something to eat or drink and you're allowed to play any of the games they have for as long as you want (Video games or board games). That's the cool part. They have about 6 tables with screens where they connect the console that you want to use and you play freely. They also have about 8 tables for you to play just board games. So this is like Snakes and Lattes.. but you don't have to pay a cover to play AND you can play video games. Now.. The food they have is terrible. I had a panini and tried the vanilla cake. I didn't have food that bad in a loooong time. Games, tables and chairs are not clean. They are greasy and smelly. It's obvious that they don't clean the controls or consoles at all. People go there, drink, eat and touch those controllers with dirty hands and they don't clean them? Wow! The only okay thing was the nutella decaf coffee. And I ordered it because they didn't have ice-cream for the milkshakes. The selection of games is not very large. And again, they are not clean. Customer service wasn't anything special. I didn't see alcohol anywhere, so I guessed they don't serve any alcoholic drink. They have one of each consoles (1 PlayStation, 1 Xbox, 1 Wii, Etc) and a small variety of games for each of them. When I was there, the place was pretty empty and almost all the consoles were in use. Please buy 2 of each consoles minimum if you're going to offer them as a service for people to use. I don't think I would go back to this place. It's probably good for teenagers, but not for adults.",2-star,negative
1410,cafes_list,"Came in on a Sunday late afternoon to check out the game selection as an alternative to snakes and lattes. I appreciate that there is no cover fee, but there is also no service. We stood awkwardly at the front for a few minutes before we accepted that no one was going to come either to the bar area or to let us know how it worked. We sat down expecting someone to come by... which didn't happen. We didn't get to order a drink because there was never an employee behind the service counter, and no one came to ask. We awkwardly checked out one of the games but mostly sat there, chatting at an empty table, for a good hour and a half before leaving. Decent game selection, but overall not the ideal choice.",3-star,negative

It was challenging but exciting, and thankfully there wasn't a group right behind us so we went a few minutes over the 50 minutes, but solved it!

Another girl who plugged in our console to the tv at the table for drinks, had her butt hanging out when she bent over to plug it in... skirt was waaayyy too short if i can see half her butt/underwear, she also gave us the wrong remote controllers, didn't really acknowledge if she was done setting up or not, we had to ask another staff and he figured out it was the wrong controllers.",2-star,negative

Prior to the room, we passed the time playing guitar hero, super mario and cards against humanity. A great selection of board games to choose from!

The room itself was nice and cozy, and there was no line up either (though I expect that to change as more people find out about this place). There was a good variety of board games, but not as much as perhaps the other board cafes I've been to. The service was ordinary - no one was rude, but neither were the staff exceptionally friendly. The worst thing about my experience was the food - tiny portions, pretty bad taste, just sub-par in general.

You could easily spend 2 hours here without noticing the time flying by... Great place for new friends. The food and drinks were ok. I ordered a sandwich and chips because I was very hungry. I will come back and try other things, because everything on their cafe menu is decently priced (all under $7).",4-star,positive
1426,cafes_list,"After having gone here for a Yelp event last year I was thoroughly impressed and decided to come back with my friends. Located quite conveniently on Yonge/Wellesley area it's easily accessible by TTC. It's on the 2nd floor so you will need to climb some stairs. There is no cover charge to come here which is amazing. You can book the rooms online and while you are waiting or after you finish trying to escape the rooms you can play their board games and/or video games in their lounge area. There is also a small cafe where you can get coffees/teas/shakes as well as cakes/pastries and Japanese popcorn (addicting!). The best part is - the cafe prices are cheap! Love it! I had the mango basil smoothie and the japanese popcorn. Nice snack while playing games. They have a wide variety of board games - everything from your standard Jenga, Scrabble, Cards of Humanity to a lot of obscure games i never heard of (Exploding Kittens anyone?). For $25 on the weekend (per person to do one of the escape rooms) this is a great deal! I believe there are currently 4 different rooms you can try at varying degrees of difficulty. I believe they are adding one or two new ones soon. All the staff are super friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back. Riddle me this...riddle me that :) And yes - my group escaped the room!

Best of all there is NO COVER!!! You just need to order one thing each minimum. I always feel ripped off at board game cafes that charge cover as I always do order as a courtesy and of course I get hungry and thirsty as we play!! They have multiple booths set up with tv screens. You can choose to play board games or hook up a game consol. There are multiple game consoles to choose from, you can go old school with N64 or go with more recent titles on an xBox. They have a good range of board games to choose from. Nowhere near as many as Snakes and Lattes, but all the most popular social games are there with MANY copies so you don't have to worry about hogging games before other tables get there. Customer service was excellent. The staff seem really chill and friendly all the time and try to make your stay as comfortable as possible. My friends and I all ordered different drinks. The staff were really good about coming by to check if the people that ordered tea wanted more water. The lattes had super cute latte art. They are very talented here! It's worth it to just come by for the latte itself!",5-star,positive
1428,cafes_list,Really nice environment and awesome snacks too! My favourite snack is the Japanese popcorn and it's only $1.75.

And they also have lots of retro gaming (lots of fun playing Mario Party 64!), so that's cool too! I tried the Pizza Panini and it was pretty good, with a side of paprika flavored chips and dipping sauce. Also it was just 6$ which is a steal!

1434,cafes_list,"This place is actually my second home. When I first came to riddle room, I didn't know what to expect. I use to always go to places like Castle and Snakes and Lattes, but once I took those steps through the door, I was instantly hooked. Old school games, board games, escape rooms, latte art, japanese popcorn, great staff, and most importantly, NO COVER CHARGE! I hate it when I want to spend the afternoon with some friends at other board game cafes but forced to pay attention to the time because I'm paying per hour. At riddle room, the rule is to just buy something. So whether it is a $5 nutella latte (so good) or $1.75 seasoned chips, it just feels you're getting the bang for your buck. The atmosphere is also a lot more homey, unlike some other places that are really dimmed and makes it hard to play the games. The escapes rooms are also really fun and pretty challenging. There are currently 4 rooms at RR, and i've done every room except for one (Luci's Room). My team and I made it on the leaderboards for framed (5th best time) and even though we got knocked off like a few days later, it is a life achievement that I will never forget (just kidding). The price for escape rooms on weekdays is only $20 ($25 on weekends), and since they partnered up with my UTSG (University of Toronto St. George) student group CASS (Canadian Asian Student Society), I am able to get a complimentary drink after every escape room session! CASS members just have to show their membership cards to one of the workers before doing the rooms. Pretty awesome perk if I do have to say so myself. :) The coffee here is amazing, the smoothies are sweet, the popcorns and chips have special seasoning that no other place can replicate, and the cheesecakes are hella good. Everyone should totally come drop by and try Riddle Room for themselves and I'm almost certain that you will want to return again in the future.",5-star,positive
1435,cafes_list,"I did my first ever escape room! I went with a large group and unfortunately we had to split up into two smaller groups for the rooms (there was 8 of us to begin with). Some of my friends had recently visited the Riddle Room and were already in love with the place. I can totally see why. It's $20/person to do a room on a weekday, $25 on the weekends. That is a bit pricey, however, when compared to other escape room prices, more affordable. I did the room called Framed. The staff can be contacted by walkie, and while they won't tell you how to solve your problem, they will try to direct you so you can solve it yourself. At the end, we got to take group pics with the props they have. We didn't play any board games, however, I do know that there isn't a cover/fee for playing the games. You simply need to order something from the cafe (and the prices are very reasonable) and enjoy the games with your friends! Will definitely be coming back to do more escape rooms, but also to enjoy some of their games; the location is super convenient for me!",4-star,positive

Took us a lil longer to figure out, but there's nothing better than feeling accomplishment, ESPECIALLY when u break out of jail!!! Too. Much. Fun! Anyway, there's plenty to keep ur inner kid occupied and enough to keep the adult in u enjoy life again!

The Rockabrownie is a tad too creamy and not as many flavours or textures as the Raspberry Fudge so I probably would not order that one again.

On the plus side it is in a great location with nice outdoor seating outside for the summer and the staff is always friendly and efficient But I do find that this Rocaberry location is not up to par with some of the others I have been to. They have limited indoor seating which is not horrible since you usually don't end up waiting too long for a seat. However, the main reason I feel like this location isn't my favourite is actually because of the pies themselves :( the last few times I went the pie did not seem as fresh as it should be, the flavour was off and the food was mediocre. I realize this is a chain but i have had much better quality of food and desserts at their saint Leonard branch for example. If you are going to the Monkland location i would steer clear of the pies and opt more for the cheesecakes. that's just my opinion though and I hope i just had some bad luck when I went in.",3-star,negative

The only thing that's a shame is that the Monkland location is simply too small. I counted 6 tables today. You often have to wait, and the place feels crammed.

They also have pretty good meals, but the desserts are definitely the star here. I would suggest you go in a small group as there isn't much seating. If it is full, no need to fret just get a pie to go!",4-star,positive
1452,cafes_list,One of the best coffee shops around Arizona State University (ASU) and conveniently situated near the light rail and downtown Mill Ave. Their baristas are always very nice when I come here.

Yelp pointed me toward this little darling and I'm so glad! The barista was friendly, chatty; in my experience baristas are either very friendly or completely merged with their machine. This fellow was the former and pulled an excellent Americano. Agave and simple syrup at the ready; these are things that make me happy to see and tell me the place knows it's craft. Also I loved the Damien Hirst piece in the background and the fact that the barista was knowledgeable about the artist and his work. Totally a win.",5-star,positive

1461,cafes_list,"Royal is easily my favorite unique coffee shop in Tempe; the tiny setting is cozy, the huge windows cause the place to feel very bright and open, and the patio is a perfect hangout spot during a nice day. The concrete bricks, wood tables, and huge lights remind me of a New York City style bar, which is a nice change of scenery here in Az. While the prices are a bit on the high end for some of the drinks, you get what you pay for- the Chai Tea here is easily one of the best I've ever had, and their coffees are fantastic as well. Overall, if you're looking for something different, or a great place to do some studying/work, Royal is definitely worth checking out.",5-star,positive
1462,cafes_list,"This is a really cute and small coffee shop near ASU. The menu isn't overwhelming, which makes it easy for you to order. In addition to the classic espresso items you see everywhere, they have a selection of teas, including a cactus blossom!! This, I was pretty excited to see, since I always feel as though I can brew my own earl grey/jasmine/chai/etc. at home. Royal is fairly small and the set up here is fairly simple and neat, and the music is calming to listen to, but not distracting if you like to listen to your own. There aren't very many outlets if you're trying to study with low batteried electronics. If you're trying to read a book or get some non-electronic work done, this place is perfect! With the set up, you get lots of natural AZ sunshine streaming in to make your work day just a little brighter. My only qualm that keeps this from 5 stars is the lack of restroom int his building directly. And the parking is metered only. Unfortunate, but still worth stopping by otherwise!",4-star,positive

I ordered a Hazelnut Latte and the lemon blueberry scone, and let's just say it was BOMB! I wanted to get them both again while I was there, but I hesitated. The baristas were good and were very involved with the customers and doing small talk with everyone. The place was quiet too, which is different from some of the other coffee shops around Tempe. It's a little bit of a hike from my apartment on the other side of campus, but well worth the walk. I WILL be back here again! P.S. They play music over the speakers and for a good hour or so they were playing country music (which I despise) but I dealt with it. The great coffee and atmosphere made up for it!",5-star,positive
1467,cafes_list,"This is a great little coffee bar close to campus. It's convenient for a coffee break whenever I have a break from work, where I can take my laptop and grade some papers with a good environment. I wish they had a bit of a broader drink selection, since one of those terrible people who actually enjoys frappes from Starbucks. However, the staff here is incredibly friendly and accommodating. I asked them for something for my sweet tooth and they made me a mocha with cinnamon and chai in it. It was delicious and different! And I would have never known to ask for it. I've also gotten some of their tea here, over ice. It was delicious. I recommend if you're looking for some quiet away from the buzz of campus.",4-star,positive
1468,cafes_list,"Absolutely fantastic coffee, made to order, with friendly staff who are happy to be chatty or leave you be. A small patio and inside bar area, which is perfect considering that most people grab and go to or from ASU Tempe. Coffee has been consistently great over the past 6 months I've been going, and if there are ever any mistakes the staff is quickly down to remake drinks for you. For the quality everything is priced well. That, and the staff makes this a great place for coffee lovers who want legit, honest, good coffee.",5-star,positive
1469,cafes_list,"Ugh. I wanted to love or at least highly like this place, but I can't! I came in on a weekday to get coffee beans because it is very close to the parking structure I use at work. The space is tiny - I actually had to wait in line outside of the door before making it inside. The service seemed slow - which is to be expected for single pour over coffees. This part didn't bother me...but the fact that the person taking orders was also the person making coffee was hard to wrap my head around. I had to wait for the 5 people in front of me to think out their orders, order, pay, and then have the employee make their orders before I could buy my bag of beans. This was annoying (as was the conversation of said 5 people that I had to listen to while waiting). The beans themselves (once brewed at home - using a french press as recommended as well as a chemex) were OK, but definitely not the best bean you can get in Phoenix. Will stick to Cartel when I need to buy beans close to ASU.",2-star,negative

The staff is educated but approachable.,5-star,positive
1476,cafes_list,"I'm a fan of this place. It offers true small coffee house experience. Not many places offer Real Iced Coffee. This place offers something similar very close. They cold brew their coffee grounds in room temperature water (instead of iced or chilled water) and then serve it under the name of Iced Toddy. It's not bad. The pastries they serve are from a third party and is acceptable. I had: Iced Toddy (no sugar, no cream) Pumpkin Turnover (kind of stale if you ask me) But it the coffee's acceptable and the pastry isn't that great, why do I like it? It offers that cozy coffee house feeling, they don't make you feel as if you need to be out of there in ten minutes. Some guy was there, studying, for 5 hours or so. The place is quiet and it's pretty close to campus. The music isn't too loud and there's this huge table for spreading out. Another thing, the bathroom's a minute walk away on a different floor.",4-star,positive
1477,cafes_list,"Oh Royal... I love this place. This location is perfect - right off the light rail and on the way to campus. It's very accessible and the outdoor patio is going to be great for these cooler fall days. The coffee is premium and the baristas are always friendly. The general feel of the place is right up my alley. All of the wood and metal gives it both an urban and rustic feel. It's a wonderful coffee shop, a great place to come with a book and read, or bring your computer and get some work done.

1483,cafes_list,"I came here with a group of 7 on a Saturday afternoon for my friends High Tea birthday. We were running late but the staff at Sorelle were very friendly and accommodating to our delayed schedule. Upon arriving, we were quickly seated and our server explained the different tea options we have. There is a a wide variety of teas to choose from including Jasmine, green, rooibos and many more. I chose the Persian tea which was delicious. Everyone is given either loose tea leaves or a tea bag and a few pots of hot water which is refilled periodically. Each table is also given coconut and soy milk on the side. We all enjoyed the teas we chose and the entire atmosphere was very nice. The cups, pots, saucers and cutlery were beautiful. A special shout out to our server, I think her name is Eva, who was friendly and did a great job! We were served 2 trays of bite-sized sandwiches/ hors d'ouveurs and a tiered tray of sweets. The savoury food was mediocre at best. I was expecting more flavour and quantity for the $40 per person price. Also, I suggest that tea leaves be changed to a fresh batch at least once. The tea loses strength after a couple of cups. Overall, I would return here for the cute atmosphere, friendly service and tasty sweets. The high tea is good but not worth to do again.",3-star,negative

I had the grilled cheese with vegetables and the side salad. The grilled cheese was good, I just wasn't expecting the vegan cheese to be so thick. The bread did not taste like gluten free bread! The dressing on the salad was amazing, it was a kind of balsamic I think. The portions were a little small, however. I also had the cinnamon donut, which reminded me of a churro! The interior of the store is so cute, bright and airy! While walking up the stairs to the dining room, you can see into the kitchen while they are cooking. This would be a nice place to have a lowkey bridal shower or birthday! We did not come during the 3-6pm high tea time, so I'm not sure how that works.",4-star,positive
1486,cafes_list,"Came here with a group of friends. We booked in advance for the high tea experience. Also an fyi, they require a deposit over the phone when making reservations. The exterior of the cafe is cute. Like a little light teal blue house on the corner of the street. Inside it's modern and posh. With two levels. Lower main level is the open kitchen, bakery/cake display and a few customer seatings. Along the stairs there are glam glam disco ball chandeliers. Upstairs there is a open window private room, washroom and some more seats. The plates and dishware were a very cute floral pastel colour Victorian Style. Along side with Golden Cutlery. They had a whole list of different type of teas. I choose Peaches & Cream. The tea leaves comes in the same floral ceramic dishware. It's placed on top of the teacup and you are required to pour hot water on top to seep the tea. There is also a choice of Coconut or Soy Cream. Our savoury finger foods consist of mini cubed vegan grilled cheese, mini bitesize pizzas, lettuce pinwheel wraps, & some sort of tortilla spoon with zuchinni bell pepper salsa. They were all tasty, but I find the pinwheel texture a bit mushy. The 3 tier dessert tray was so cute and pretty. Top was 2 types of cupcakes, Chocolate & Strawberry Vanilla. They were so very moist and tasty. Second tier was strawberry and citrus jelly candies, strawberry lemon tart, and Chocolate S'more Tarts. The jellies were a bit sweet. Both the tarts are delish! Bottom tier was Raspberry Sugar Cookies, Brownie Cookies, Donuts, and Blueberry Scones. I love all of them expect for the donut and scones. Donuts were a little dense and scones were a little crumbly and a bit dry. But I did try it with their in house jam and devon cream. So it was a bit better with the condiments. I especially like the raspberry cookies, the texture was really interesting and crispy. Overall I love the experience and would come back to try other items.",5-star,positive

This use to be a post office and general store :) When you walk in, you already get the summer tea time feel with the bright white interior and case laid out with beautiful pastries. I like that they offer gluten free desserts so any one can really enjoy a treat here. They also have a rainbow colored cupcake where proceeds go to sick kids :) awesome! I had a orange blueberry donut. I'm not big on sweets so this was 100% way too sweet for me. But I loved the flavor! Orange really paired well with the sweet dessert and I had a nice bittersweet cappuccino to wash it down. It's a cute environment and I think I'd be happy to stop by again and maybe try something a bit less sweet :)",4-star,positive
1488,cafes_list,"So far, the best place I've been to. Went here on a Tuesday evening with my friend. Everyone who works here is amazing and super friendly and polite. The decor is absolutely beautiful and sophisticated. Don't be fooled, you do not need to dress up. I went here with my leather jacket and did not feel out of place at all. Everyone was so welcoming. We both had the Blue Power smoothie (I had coconut milk, my friend had orange juice) it was the best smoothie ever. We ordered the pizza and avocado toast and I fell in love with their food right away. The spice, flavours were perfect. For dessert we had the maple tart, and a muffin. So amazing. We ended up buying some of their granola and a couple of treats for home!! Definitely recommend this place to everyone I know!",5-star,positive
1489,cafes_list,"A shop that serve vegan items and it included many desserts/cakes/cookies and hot plates. The decor of this place looks quite classy, clean, and fancy. The staff are polite and friendly so first impression is very good. As soon as I stepped inside, there are many people in the line, a good sign. So we waited for a table and luckily, we got a table finally. Since it's lunch time, we ordered hot plate. We tried the Mushroom soup, Lasagna, Potatoe Croquette, and a Kale/Romaine Lettuce Caesar salad. As these food are dairy free, meatless items, the final products are quite excellent. Better than I expected! :) The Mushroom soup is light and filled with mushroom aroma, similar to the kind I have tried in Oliver & Bonicinni, but this one taste lighter, in a pleasant way of course. My guess is they probably use vegetable stock and this place after all, is meatless. I will have it again next time. But they also offer Minestrone soup as well which I havent try ... should i try that next time or should I stick with mushroom.. wish I have more than 1 stomach. :) A recommended item from me! For the Lasagna, it's all veggie and vegan cheese. i don't know what they put in there but boy, its good!! another recommended item from me! As for the potato Croquette, it is served with some kind of Apple sauce and also some white ""creamy"" sauce that have a little kick from the cayenne pepper (I think it's cayenne pepper). I dont know what's in the white sauce but it sure looks like cream sauce but I am sure they didn't use any cream as it's dairy free. I find that if you eat a small piece of croquette together with some apple sauce and the white sauce, the taste from the three blends together quite well, in my opinion. Another recommended item from me! The Kale and Romaine Lettuce Caesar, .. well, its ok, nothing particular that I like or don't like. Unless you want some green to add some fibre to your diet, it would be a good choice. They also offer other salad as well. but if you have limited stomach space, skip this one. Looks like my first visit to this shop is mainly hot plates and I haven't even tried their sweets items. I cannot leave this place without at least trying one!! So I tried their chocolate cookie and a cup of their brewed coffee at the end. It's good!! The coffee actually goes quite well with the cookie, but at that point, I was like 120% full and I have to stop, even though there are also other items I wanted to try. One note though, the price is on the higher side for a typically lunch but it's worth it in my opinion. It's not easy to find a good vegan place that offer palatable dishes. I would pick this place over Rawlicious anytime whenever I want something light and with veggie. Again, just my opinion. Another note, I think I saw another review mentioning upstair was closed due to private event, it also happen to my visit today. So i guess, private function is getting popular for this place on Sunday(?) so if you plan to visit this place, call ahead to check or there could be some waiting to do if you wanna dine in.",4-star,positive

The grits weren't edible. The only thing I ate that was ok was the eggs and fries. 2 things of which are extremely difficult to mess up. The pancakes were ok tasted like store bought mix nothing great. All in all if ever in CLT I would definitely not return. For a $30 breakfast after tax and tip I expect a little bit more.

We also ordered a strawberry Nutella crepe with Tiramisu gelato I didn't like the gelato because had too much of an alcoholic taste. The crepe itself was delicious. Soft and chewy. Strawberries were sweet! Loved the crepe here! $10 for both. They have free wifi, but it didn't work for me. Maybe the server was down. Prices are totally reasonable.

Asked for an Iced Mocha, but the server said they cannot make it ""iced"" without an explanation and PUSHED me to order an iced cappuccino. I said no, I want to change it to an Iced Cafe Latte. She said sure, but then comes back saying they cannot make it ""iced"" and PUSHED me again to order an iced cappuccino. I rarely order a cappuccino but was ""convinced"" they can make a delicious cappuccino. At that point, I caved in because the 2 women were selling me the iced cappuccino SO HARD, only to be SO disappointed. I offered the drink back to them because I no longer wanted it--I was expecting ice cubes but received an ice-blended cappuccino and it tasted awful. They were so bitchy and asked me if I knew what an espresso is. I obviously said yes, a fucking Mocha and Cafe Latte has espresso in it too. NEVER GOING BACK.",1-star,negative

1515,cafes_list,"I'm a huge crepe fan and this is my go to place now. I found it accidently when I was walking by it one day. It turns out it was their first day opening. To be honest I wasn't expecting much at first, I was thinking it might be more like a bbt place with mediocre desserts, but boy was I glad I was wrong (there are no bbt drinks in the menu right now, but they do have a good variety of caffeine drinks, smoothies and teas. They did say to me last time that when their spring/summer menu comes out they will add bbt). They also have free wifi :) First impressions: place was clean, tidy, and bright. You don't always get that when you go to resturants in Chinatown. Decor was simplistic like a casual cafe you can go to to do some work or relax. Staff was very friendly, all smiles and greeted you as you came in. It felt like a family owned shop type of feel and I really like that. You also see the crepe making area as soon as you get in, like most crepe places, the work area looked cleaned which is always good. They also have their gelatos lined for you to see as soon as you walked in which made me more excited to try out their gelatos. They have around 5 or 6 gelatos flavors to choose from and some ice cream. Price: pretty decent for crepes. They range from 7$ to 9$ before tax depending on what you get. They also serve hot drinks and teas, I thought the price was decent and fair. Drinks typically 3-7$ range, again depends on what you get. You can also buy gelato by the scoop without the crepes for 4$. Service: very friendly and approachable, open to suggestions (they asked how the crepes were - we had ordered one meat lover crepe and a gelato party crepe. The meat lover crepe had too much mayo on it, we let her know to put less next time and she was very receptive to that suggestion saying they just opened and don't mind any feedback we had. The next time we came in we ordered the same and they had changed how much mayo they now put on it. I have since order the same crepe a few times and have no complaints. I like how when you order tea they use nice tea cups and their tea lists shows how much caffeine and antioxidants each tea has (I.e., low, moderate etc.) Taste: I gotta say I am a big fan of their crepes, it's definitely on the thicker side which I like compared to other crepes. My fave is the gelato party, it has fruits, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and your choice of a scoop of their gelato. It's a good portion size that definitely satisfies my sweet tooth! Overall I'm really enjoying this place and what it has to offer. It's perfect for a cute date or to go to do some work, (it has jazz music in the background that's provides a relaxing ambiance, sometimes I don't even notice the music playing which is what I prefer). I think it will fill a need in the area since there's not too many dessert places in this location!",5-star,positive

The atmosphere is very nice. Quiet jazz. Comfortable chairs and solid tables, which is a must for me. It is a perfect place to sit pleasantly with a friend or by yourself.

I have never in my life been to a store in the afternoons where the barista is the only cashier so if there is cars in the drive thru you have to wait 6-9 minutes to place and order after he is 100% done and never in my 300+ stores have I came in to contact with this idea. I even discussed this with a corporate manager that I know in seattle that works with starbucks and he said this falls on the shift and the manager and that another employee should have rung you up because we try to keep a certain time criteria of customers in que and pick up. I have had employees look at me and walk in the back every single time while waiting. I did not start timing my waits till the third time I came in after waiting for very long periods of time in a line that had no people in front or behind me at 7'sh and it took every time 6-9 minutes to take my order and yes one of them took just shy of ten minutes. This store has no people character nor does it have great customer service so far and there is no way to fix this with me.

Living in Arizona, aka Satan's armpit, I had to have an iced drink after lugging my 4 month old in his car seat with a 4.5 year old dragging behind thru the grocery store. The girl at the drive thru was super pleasant and asked me how my day was going. My drink, however, was luke warm, which was kind of disappointing but I swirled it around and it got colder.

I HATE the pastry display. This might seem to be the dumbest reason to dock a star. But I'm hoping that management sees this, because I've talked to baristas about it, and they agree, and have been pushing for this to be changed themselves for a while from what they said. What's the problem with it? There's no door on the back. Why is this a problem? Fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. I would LOVE to buy a blueberry cream cheese Danish...but I can't, EVER, because flies are ALWAYS in there. YES this REQUIRES ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE.

1562,cafes_list,"BEST COFFEE IN MADISON! After returning from Italy with a significant addiction to espresso, I discovered that all espresso is not created equal in the US! The espresso in Italy was so smooth that I consistently drank it straight with no sugar. Back here, espresso tends to be excessively bitter and weaker. It seems that most coffee shops split shots, which forces twice as much water through the same amount of coffee making the espresso much weaker. Steep & Brew not only has a consistently excellent roast (it's been bitter a few times but I'd still give them a 95% for consistency) but they also serve a straight shot. Frankly, you are getting more for your money AND better coffee. They have an excellent selection of coffees and will brew a cup of whichever variety you desire. Their tea selection is also very diverse and attention is paid to proper steeping times. Complete with a nice sitting area with room to read, meet a friend or study with a group, it's hard to beat this locally owned coffee shop!

The baked goods aren't made on-site, but they're always fresh and enjoyable (and huge, but that's the way it is everywhere). Sometimes the place gets crowded, but they take care of you as quickly as they can, and in spite of a fair amount of turnover, they always seem to have a friendly staff that knows what they're serving. My chosen coffee-shop comparison index treat, iced mocha, comes out just fine here, though it doesn't make the best-ever level.

I usually travel to Badger town at least once a year, and I never seem to be able to find a really good cup of Joe, unless it's here. Located smack dab in the middle of State street, near all the traffic and shopping, Steep & Brew is friendly little coffee house with a fantastic assortment of pastries and drinks. I might also add that the staff is friendly, cool and very attentive to your cafe desires. During the warmer months, this is one of my favorite places to sit outdoors and people watch. Trust me, you will see folks from all walks of life, young and old, walking down State Street. Steep & Brew has outdoor seating, which is conveniently situated along the sidewalk.

Don't expect any novel flavours, they mainly have just the classics. You can try a sample or two if unsure of what you want. The roasted hazelnut brought my back to Italy. Very rich in flavour and it has hazelnut pieces inside. SO liked the butter pecan which was also rich and flavourful. This ice cream melts rather quickly so eat it inside or in the shade. Definitely go for the waffle cone which is made in-house...it's already included the price so why go for the sugar cone?",5-star,positive

It's homemade and made with lots of love. It's creamy and not icy. It has so many different options including frozen yogurt. Also they made their waffle cones fresh. I go for my favourite flavours - Cookie Cookie & White Chocolate. They have loads of crazy flavours including; Toronto Pothole, Simply Butterscotch and Almond Butter Toffee. Also they have an amazing flavour; Apple Cinnamon - That has real apples and cinnamon. Keep Eating, Angela",5-star,positive
1581,cafes_list,"With this absolute heat wave in the middle of what's supposed to be fall, Ice cream is just the best solution to beat the heat, and Summer's is definitely the wise choice. This was recommended to me by other Toronto locals. Straight away, I was told, ""you need to get the waffle cone cause it's amazing"", and boy was I not steered wrong. It's fresh and crispy, the perfect complement to your ice cream of choice. You can definitely get a couple of samples before making your decision and with that kind of selection, it's easy to see why! I've been told some of the stand out flavours include the Toronto Pothole (gravel not included), and the Campfire marshmallow. I went with good ol cookie dough, and I was not disappointed. Everything is homemade and you can really tell the difference. The cookie dough isn't like what you'd get in a tub of ice cream where it's in little chunks, but crumbles swirled into it. I can't wait to come back and try other flavours! With it located on such a beautiful street, it's definitely the perfect place to grab a cone, and sit outside to just bask in the ambiance or people watch.",5-star,positive
1582,cafes_list,"Best ice cream place in TDot! I love their Pistachio & Chocolate Lover's Chocolate. The Taste & Service are very consistent in the 5 summers that I've been here.

1583,cafes_list,WHAT TO TRY?? Their homemade ice cream! They've been serving ice cream in yorkville since 1985. A truly Canadian shop for more than 35 years! Their ice cream comes in soooo many different flavors and it's all made fresh daily. Their sorbets and yogurts also taste really good! I had their campfire marshmallow since I've never tried the marshmallow flavor and it actually is a flavor that requires more technical skills as I've been told by someone who makes ice cream a lot. I like the ice cream is served in a cone because their cones also taste really crisp and fresh as well. I think I will try the sorbets next time because their sorbets are so refreshing! LAST TIP? don't be scared to test out their flavors first before committing to buying a cone. You can opt for one or two scoops and you can mix and match if you want two scoops. Sit outside by the bench and do some people and car watching as you enjoy your ice cream! Enjoy!,5-star,positive
1584,cafes_list,"Fairly wide variety of flavour selections to choose from. I got the Pistachio - it tasted pretty good and you can actually find the bits and pieces of pistachio!

He kept us waiting for almost 25 mins, and my friend had finished the ice cream in the shop. He served with frowns and impatience, and seemed to be blaming the customers for the problem, while pressing the cash register aggressively. When I approached and ask him how long are we going to wait, another girl server with blonde hair told the guy:""just let them have the free scoop"", yet the guy completely ignored her and refused to let us go and DID NOT APOLOGIZE WHATSOEVER.

They're located in the lower level of a building, making them one of the city's better kept secrets. Not so secret, I suppose, as they've got a collection of photos on the wall from celebrity visitors. It's an elegantly designed space with adequate space for those queuing in line. The displays and decor all work well together. I must've come on the day where the lone staff member had an uneventful day, as he didn't seem enthused to be selling ice cream. However, I've been here in the past and received friendly service, so I won't hold it against them. As far as the ice cream goes, it's very good. From a flavour and texture perspective, I'd say it's some of the best I've had in a while. Waffle cones are a must for me every time I visit. Price is also a huge plus here, with a single scoop and waffle cone costing just $4.95, taxes included. At that price, you really can't complain too much.",4-star,positive

I love Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey so gave the Summer's Funky Monkey a try - a great twist with pineapple, coconut, walnuts and chocolate chips. A single scoop cone will run just under $5, not cheap but the right amount of sweet without overdoing it. I look forward to going back and trying some of the other flavours - a sample of dark chocolate orange might not be enough next time!",5-star,positive

When I finally placed my order he literally slammed the scoops of ice cream into cups and was rolling his eyes the entire time. I chuckled as I wasn't sure if it was a joke or not. Was I being set up on a reality TV show? That's how it felt. Anyhow, said thank you and have a good night regardless of the ignorant customer service and was replied to with ""yeah."" Never again.

Their homemade waffle cones are to die for, but you can have your chosen ice cream in a cup if you prefer. They also have homemade milkshakes which I have yet to try, although they sound delicious.

They know my name, my preferences... this place is a real treat all around. They carry a rotating menu of seasonal specials to augment a solid lunch menu, with offerings for everyone (vegan, veggie, GF, meat lovers, etc)! In the warm season, I like to sit outside and soak up the sunshine while I munch on local greens and whatever seasonal wonder is up for grabs that day. PS-they'll be starting happy hour soon.

There are daily specials and a standing menu, and having been here a couple of times I have tried a few things and have yet to be disappointed. The decor is simple and friendly, and it always feels bright and airy in there with the big windows facing out to the street. This time around our party ordered jambalaya, which had a ""nice heat"" and a healthy portion of mixed greens as a side, and tomato soup which was creamy and rich. I had the beef burrito which had perfect heat for my taste (which is probably mild to medium) and was grilled so the tortilla had a nice crunch to it. That came with chips and salsa as a side. Portions are perfect. They have a great craft beer selection and a wine selection as well.

Second time I had one of their deli case sandwiches that was turkey, mixed greens, walnuts and a cranberry mayo on a some sort of multigrain bread. You had a choice of getting it served grilled or cold. Super awesome. The cranberry mayo paired with everything perfectly. Very reasonably priced and always a friendly staff.

It was the exasperated sigh when I corrected them, I could've fucking done without. Still didn't get an iced skim latte. Also, when I point to something and use the proper name of it, I feel like it shouldn't be a problem for an individual of average intelligence. I ordered an apple dumpling, pointed to the apple dumpling, and thought I was watching them put it in there, until I turned my head for a second, and got a fucking Danish.

The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down.",5-star,positive

1636,cafes_list,"I love this place. It's great to meet up with one (or a couple) of people here but there is very limited seating. It's nice to be able to bring your dog and sit outside in the warmer months, though! The staff is always so incredibly friendly and talkative - always there to suggest things and to make you laugh.

1637,cafes_list,"Back in Highland Park these days, and this is still one of the best places around. See original review below! ONE QUICK NOTE: I was in here recently, working working working on my laptop with headphones, looked up, and the place was empty and the two employees left were cleaning everything. I asked ""are you guys closing?"" ""Yeah... we closed at 9:00"" was the response. It was 9:25 at this point. ""Oh my gosh, I'm sorry..."" and before I could finish the guy laughed and said ""yeah... our website is a liar. It says we are open until 10. We're not."" They weren't jerks, they didn't seem upset with me. And they earned their final star. But the note is THEY CLOSE AT 9 (the website says 10). This place is awesome! go there.",5-star,positive
1638,cafes_list,"Great variety of coffee and methods (press, Chemex, pour-over). I did not get a chance to try to the espresso, but it looked very good as well.

1639,cafes_list,"Wonderful! Lovely! Quaint! One of the most refreshing cafe's in pittsburgh! My visit was a 'surprise' from my boyfriend who knows how much I appreciate fine espresso. I was instantly enamored with the set-up inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter. The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer. Now if that isn't representative of a solid job in bringing a European Cafe to the States, then I don't know what is!",5-star,positive
1640,cafes_list,"Finally, a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee. The espresso is incredible, which makes for an excellent cappuccino, and the food is pretty good, too. Croissants, muffins, and other baked goods top the breakfast list, while made-to-order paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menu. The crowd at Enrico's is varied, which I really enjoy. My 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks, college students, techies, and other folks who are looking for a good brew. No frills, no extras; just nice people in a quaint coffee shop, brewing up warm goodness.",5-star,positive
1641,cafes_list,"As if in answer to my prayer. I'm not basing this review on the quality of the coffee. I had Rooibos tea and a (delicious) apple galette. I'm basing this on the fact that I love this style of coffee shop (could be in Seattle or Portland). And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well, to be fair, all the partying college students on the South Side last night were not grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at Tozza Doro are just chilling, quietly dong whatever they are doing, and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed. They don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries, but they do have free wireless. There is not as much in this neighborhood as I thought there was going to be, but if you find yourself here, and you like non-corporate, home grown cafes, this is a great place to chill.",5-star,positive

You can tell that it is a locally owned, family run business and the staff was extremely personable. They get 5 stars! I got the parmesan chicken salad sandwich and it was good, not great. It was served warm with chicken salad and cheese only. It was very basic. The salad was also super basic and the Italian dressing tasted like Wish-Bone from the grocery store. My colleague got the turkey club and it looked good! I wished that I ordered it when the food came. His looked much better than mine! There aren't many restaurants near them so i'm sure they get business from the nearby corporations!",3-star,negative
1664,cafes_list,Had a great breakfast. Read other reviews before going. A. Little nervous that we would get yelled at or regulars make us uncomfortable. This did not happen. Regulars welcomed us and great service. Can't wait to go back. Small but cute. Back again and everyone is super nice again. Great food.,5-star,positive
1665,cafes_list,"This is the epitome of an A-OK kind of restaurant. It's nothing like a lot of other breakfast spots in Scottsdale, and that's good and bad. It's very much a diner at heart. A handful of tables inside, a few tables outside, and some seats at a counter. The food is fine. It's nothing you'll rave about, but it's fine. My Burrito was good (though a bit lacking in Ham), and I was a bit surprised the side of Bacon only came with 2 pieces (though they were very tasty). My wife got an omelette and said it was good, but something she could probably make at home. The service was good, but you could definitely feel how small the restaurant is since you could overhear every conversation the staff was having with one another. It's around $7 or $8 per entree, so overall I'd say if you're looking for a fairly inexpensive, simple breakfast, this is a good choice. Enjoy!",3-star,negative
1666,cafes_list,I've had both breakfast items and lunch items here everything I've tried is delicious my favorite breakfast is the chicken fried steak and my favorite lunch is the philly cheese steak. Don't forget to try their muffins too. Mmm! The service could use some work but the food is fantastic.,5-star,positive

1669,cafes_list,"Wonderful, quaint and subtle American diner espresso bar. Filled with snow-birds and tucked away in an isolated strip mall. Enjoying a triple shot vanilla latte. Obviously going for the Chicago esque neighborhood vibe. Vanilla latte was decent, nothing too amazing but also nothing inherently bad. Will come back and I'm glad to of been a patron here. Doing 4/5 stars because nothing screamed unique or out of the normal. Overall I'm satisfied and will finish enjoying my coffee. Update; no WiFi was strange BUT after the chef, owner and cute little barista introduced themselves I was really pleased. Bump it up to 5-5 stars. -Thanks",5-star,positive

I recommend going to the temptations cafe!",5-star,positive
1671,cafes_list,"Expectations fully met and then some. My definition of 5 stars! Temptations Cafe just really great breakfast food, with super friendly service (owners mindset, come to think of it, that probably was one of the owners!). Nice menu with a bit of everything to cover the breakfast scene. Eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, espresso drinks, etc., etc. Most important, a nice patio with some shade that is dog friendly! Staff immediately brought us a nice cold bowl of water for our pup. Highly recommended for breakfast anytime of day.",5-star,positive
1672,cafes_list,"OMG, I love this place. It's very close to my house, and it's been there all along - I am writing this as a reminder to myself to go here more often. The owners are the sweetest people ever. Best iced coffee within a mile of my house. My girlfriend used to pick up breakfast for us from here on weekends, but then Pesto Prima opened up and we started doing that. Well, we are going to have to start alternating. The food here is fantastic. I feel kinda guilty for not going here much over the last year, but I'm definitely glad I rediscovered this place. I mean, if you want to roll up to Breakfast Club in the clothes you slept in and wait in line for average eggs and bacon and sub-par coffee so you can be ""seen"" out to brunch - that's what you're going to do - if you want awesome food and coffee in a sweet little cafe, then come here. The owner said they might start delivering soon - if that happens, holy cow. *crosses fingers*",5-star,positive
1673,cafes_list,I stopped at Temptations Cafe today. I love the locally owned businesses in Scottsdale and had heard good things about this Cafe. I was pleasabtly surprised and left 100% satisfied. I had the Country Fried Steak which came with 2 eggs and a delicious biscuit. Coffee was great. Friendly attentitive staff could not have been nicer and was interested in my happiness during my visit. The owner Nancy came out and spoke with me and made me feel like I was a regular.

1675,cafes_list,"YIKES! Avoid this place! I was a little wary because of the mostly bad reviews, but was really astonished at getting yelled at!! WOW. Starting at the worst, I ordered a corned beef sandwich (yeah, cold cuts, should have only taken a few minutes, since there was no one else there) and a coke (that was the wateriest coke I've ever received - it must have been sitting there for hours). After sitting there for well over half an hour with my husband (we're on our lunch break and expected to receive the sandwiches long before then). Keep in mind, there is NO ONE ELSE IN THE CAFE - let that be a lesson to you! The sour-faced old man comes outside, tells us that the sourdough bread is a little off and that he wouldn't eat it, then when I explain that I don't like wheat or white), he tells me that if I want to chip my teeth on it, be his guest. Then when I say that I've decided I don't want to even eat here, he literally starts yelling at me, ""C'mon, lady!"" I don't put up with that kind of behavior. A few exits back towards the 101, we salvaged a few mins and ate at Silver Mine (or City?) Subs, which was pretty good. Avoid this ""Temptations"" cafe at all costs. Horrid service, and with stale bread, I can't even imagine the quality of the food, but thankfully we didn't get that far.",1-star,negative
1676,cafes_list,"Because of the prices and the food quality, I can't recommend this to anyone. I won't be going back. This was the first time I came to this cafe. A friend recommended it because his dad likes it. I thought it was very clean and nicely laid out. The food prices are above average. The food itself is just ok (not okay, but just ok). I make much better sandwhichs for myself at home. With better quality ingredients, and better construction. One more thing. They allowed a large dog to come into the restaurant while I was there. I love dogs, but not at restaurants. The worst part is when our server went up to it and gave it a big petting right after my food was served. Thanks for that..",2-star,negative
1677,cafes_list,"This is definitely a south Scottsdale hidden gem that has turned into one of my favorite places to grab lunch during the work week. The first time I discovered them was due to the fact that they had breakfast all day. And well, if you know me, you know this usually brings a place up a notch in my book. I love my breakfast. Their heaven sent omelet is spectacular. Their italian soda comes with cream on the side so you can add as much as you want. Yum!! Additionally the grilled cheese is to die for. I am *not* a fan of tomatoes at all but for some reason their tomato bisque I actually somewhat enjoy. And it comes with cheddar goldfish. Oh yes. And this isn't a kids meal either. If you're a Chicago native or Chicago sports fan (which I am not), you will be especially impressed.",4-star,positive
1678,cafes_list,"This is a terrific, off the beaten path, liberal leaning bookstore for the rebel and activist audience.

They don't call it Big Idea for nothing!",5-star,positive
1679,cafes_list,"I love this bookstore. The name represents the shop well, as you walk in and are overcome with the power messages every where, and the walls of beautiful books, new and used. I typically go straight to the used book section, and found many treasures here for a very reasonable price. They also have a $1 section near the front of the store, which is worth taking a look at. I have never purchased a drink here but am always impressed with their selection of teas and other beverages. This isn't the type of coffee shop to sit for hours on your laptop, but it's a great place to read a book and have a good drink. They hold events here as well, so pay attention to their calendar if you're interested in good conversation and a unique experience! Side note- If you have old books that you are looking to get rid of, you can donate them to this book shop! :)",5-star,positive
1680,cafes_list,"Great bookstore with great coffee. Do not come here if you don't have an open mind as many of the ideas in the shop would be considered ""radical"" to most. Not a great place to sit and do work but good for browsing and finding new topics to learn about.",5-star,positive
1681,cafes_list,"Just fyi, I'm probably the second furthest thing from a hippie (furthest I assume would be a republican pro-life billionaire), but I thought this bookstore was mega-cool! The sections are by political/social issues i.e. Anarchism, feminism, race politics, etc. So it's easy for people like me to browse and have our interest piqued. And it seems lk all the staff are avid readers so they usually have a recommendation or a two up their sleeve. It was lovely to see some people discussing books! Coffee is super cheap. Prob not the best place to sit for a prolonged time for free wifi with your laptop. I mean I don't think anyone would kick you out but there are only like 3-4 tables and it's pretty cramped.",5-star,positive

The book selection is *excellent* and the coffee is just as good. --A lot of times coffee shops, and in particular ones with a specific vibe in mind, end up feeling pretentious, but this place managed to keep their vision and lose the pretension and the end result is an introvert's dream. Absolutely plan on coming back!",5-star,positive

I can never go into big idea without buying something. They have everything from gender politics to vegan cookbooks to fiction, zines and more! My one complaint is that it seems that when they sell a book, they don't buy a replacement for it, which I understand to an extent, but then if you want them to order in a book it takes a few weeks to a month of two for the books to come in. If you're involved with a punk/subculture/feminist/DIY/anarcho scene this is the place to stop in Pittsburgh. And it's run by volunteers!",5-star,positive
1685,cafes_list,1. Heavenly green tea is great - mellow with just the right hint of bitter to it. 2. Owners are real nice 3. I had a flat tire on my bike so stopped here to fix it - they had a bicycle pump with an air gauge sitting right by the door 4. Everything is fair trade and/or organic 5. They obviously care about giving back as an integral part of their business 6.

1686,cafes_list,"You know, every once in a while I go to an establishment where I have conflicting feelings from 2 of my personalities. Overall, I feel that I'm a pretty laid back guy who isn't incredibly sophisticated and doesn't sweat the small stuff. However, I feel that I definitely draw the line at a certain point- and that point today was that I prefer not to enter an establishment whose baristas serve tea and goodies barefoot. I'm going to set the stage here. I've wanted to stop in this place for quite a while. I was enjoying the beautiful weather today and I got my bike out and decided to head over there. I walked in and immediately enjoyed the place: it was very anti-establishment, a nice and cozy non-profit shop (I think it's run by volunteers)- and sat down to enjoy a great cup of lavender tea. I even walked around and perused a couple sections of the small library of books. It wasn't until I sat down that I noticed that the guy behind the counter was barefoot. At first I simply tilted my head out of curiosity, but the more I thought about it the more it bothered me. I wouldn't say I'm a stickler for the rules, but this has to be breaking some health code. At one point this guy even walked to the bathroom and back. As much as I want for this not to be a big deal to me, I just can't get past it. Just as I was about to write a glowing 4-star review of this place, the horror and image of the bare feet and all of the amazingly intricate battles my two selves were having came to mind (and they involved communities of bacteria from the toilet seat rearing their ugly heads into my cup of tea). Sorry guys, maybe anarchism wasn't as cool (or clean) as I originally thought.",2-star,negative

But if you think ""radical"" is a synonym for ""interesting"" and you want want some of the best pizzelle cookies I've had in Pittsburgh, it's worth stopping in. The inside is cozy, and while they don't have a huge selection, they do delve deeply into areas (like gender politics, the politics of race) that many bookstores don't fully address. But they also have 'zines, literature, even a travel section. The best way to describe what they carry is ""thought-provoking,"" in a good way. Why not really engage with what you read, question what you know?

1689,cafes_list,"Big Idea is one of those shops that just seems like a perfect addition to Pittsburgh, in my mind anyway. Seriously, if you like tea, vegan munchies and books, then this is a shop for you! The book selection on display here alone is worth browsing - there are literally shelves and shelves of books lining the majority of the walls in the shop. And the range of things covered by these books stretches from fiction stories like ""The Hunger Games"" and famous sci-fi titles to history and philosophy topics. There's definitely a wide range of options so I think anyone could find something good to read here if they come with an open mind. As for the cafe portion of the shop, I love their tea selections, and all of their food is made from local, organic, seasonal, fair trade, and/or sustainable sourced ingredients. All of their food is vegan as well, so while it can taste a little different to the uninitiated on a first visit (which was me once upon a time), their options really grow on you if you give them a chance. Big Idea is admittedly a small-scale operation so sometimes they're a little low on food, but that's totally forgivable. They make a mean hummus and pita snack, and the staff - all volunteers - are super nice and will do whatever they can to help you; they've even offered to carry my tea back to me once it's done brewing! I've definitely come to love this cool little shop more and more over the past year, and now I stop in at least once a month for my tea, snack and book fix.

I haven't tried much in their dessert or bakery department but their food has always been satisfying and full of flavor. Their coffee is also good. Can't wait to go back to try more. The only thing that has bothered me is the one time I asked for my dish to be without egg and the waitress said, ""well that's weird"". I don't really care about anyone else's opinion on what i'm eating. I think she realized what she said was inappropriate and made up for it by finishing up with friendly service and a to-go cup of coffee.",5-star,positive

I went with my parents and we had a reservation, so we got right in (hint: make a reservation if you want to go on the weekends). It was pretty crowded, and we sat at a high top table that was so close to the table next to us, we felt like we were sharing a meal with them. Our waiter was extremely attentive and on top of things, despite how crowded it was. I ordered one of the seasonal items - the laughing bird shrimp omelette, which was delicious, with a side of potatoes that I split with my mom. At the end of the meal,w we ordered some pastries to go because they just looked too good sitting there on the bakery shelf. The bill was kind of expensive though - 3 people and it was $71. (My parents also got hot tea, and I got a mimosa.) That was my only complaint. I realize we got great quality meals, but it was a little bit of a sticker shock. It wouldn't stop me from coming back though - I would love to explore some more of the menu for brunch another day.",4-star,positive

1701,cafes_list,"-1 for prices. -1 for service. -1 for atmosphere. I'm pissed off. I'm quitting smoking right now and probably should've stayed at home, but gf had the day off and I'd been wanting to try this place. Note: first off, our waitress was just a little ""off"" and a little slow to refill drinks, etc, but the customer next to us - the weird looking chick - had no right to yell ""excuse me! I don't have brown hair!"" and hand her plate to the server like a dick! No one deserves treatment like that. That woman should've stayed home. Maybe she's quitting smoking too? Prices: are stupid, I'm sorry! It's just too high for this area. Doesn't seem to stop people from coming, though. Food: whenever I try a new place, I usually start with something on the safe side. My croissant was good, but it was topped with bacon/eggs/avocado and I couldn't help but think that I could easily make this at home. It seems pretty obvious, though, that someone knows how to bake at this place. The one other topping - the avocado vinaigrette - was tasty and would be nice on one of their fresh salads (saw another person's salad and looked good). Looking at photos from other yelpers (sorry, is that what we call ourselves?), I feel like we missed out on some delicious seafood dishes, etc. I'm sure that there is good food to be had here. Service: not very friendly, but not rude, either. My gf asked if they had refills on tea and it seemed like she just didn't want to have to deal with it, but reluctantly asked if she'd like one to go. She also seemed truly perplexed when I asked about Specials. Atmosphere: I'm not much of a hipster until it comes to music. This place was playing conventional top-40 music and it just did not fit at all! Why are the tables so close together?! We came at a time where they were not busy and, unfortunately, had people on both sides of us like we were at Hibachi Japan. Thanks to seating arrangements, we got to witness that awful, aforementioned customer, then the rest of my dining experience was ruminating on whether or not we should call this horrible human being out. This is not NYC and it's not busy - spread us out, please. Will never be back!",2-star,negative

I'll start with the staff - the manager Dave was extremely polite and helpful when I called with less than two weeks notice trying to book reservations for a large party on a Saturday morning for a bridal breakfast. On the day of our breakfast our waiter was so so so great (wish I could remember his name!). He was very charismatic and funny, and politely patient with our large party- so nice to be helped/ served by someone with so much genuine personality and not a disengaged uninterested person behaving robotically. Moving on to the food... Oh my!!! Everyone loved the food.. LOVED it! From my 80+ grandmother, to my 1 year old nephew... Full tummies and big smiles all around. The Mushroom / squash omelette was what i ordered and it was the best omelette I've ever eaten in my life. Other orders in the party that I know of included the French toast, eggs Benedict, and "" bacon and eggs"" .. Seriously, everyone LOVED their food and that's next to impossible with 15 people. My mom and my aunt flipped out when they learned that the ""creamer"" provided for hot beverages was actual CREAM.. Manager Dave, on one of his multiple visits to our group to make sure we were all happy, told us that the cream was made fresh just for the ""blue door"" .

Just went for the first time this summer, waited about 30 minutes for a patio table, and when we were finally seated we realized the menu has changed. Apparently now there is a ""weekday"" menu and a weekend ""Brunch"" menu. I loved their crepes and my husband loved their corned beef hash, but since we went on Saturday it was the brunch menu and neither of those were on the menu (and looking at their website they no longer seem to have crepes at all =(...)

Personally I like the dinner better than the breakfast/brunch but I still rate the breakfast/brunch a 4.9999999 The dinner is a $55 tasting menu where you get to choose from 2 starters, 2 first courses, 4ish entrees, and 2 desserts. There is usually a gf, vegan option in each category and they have gf bread which is so delicious my husband picks it over the regular bread! The food is soooo delicious and well thought out! Unique ingredients and combinations. This is one of those places where you're never really sure what all of the ingredients are but you know it's going to be delicious! Cons: no place to change a diaper (important to me, but not most) and the servers don't really seem to appreciate the food and they don't do the menu justice when they talk about the food (or rather just hand you the menu and ask you what you want). It would make the experience that much better if the staff was as passionate about the food as the chef was!

However, a few months ago the breakfast/brunch menu changed. I was told by one of the servers that the chef who use to only do their dinner menu was now also planning breakfast and lunch. The biggest reason my friends and I have stayed away: NO MORE FRENCH TOAST. There's just no point now. Now they often have a waffle or pancake on the menu and are charging upwards of $15 for it. The whole thing makes me upset. I feel like Cuyahoga Falls has lost a little culinary jewel. No thank you.",1-star,negative

I am not the organic loving farm to table, egg needs to have been laid today kind of foodie but I appreciated the story and concept that they offer. The presentation was beautiful for the steak and eggs, crepes and the quiche which always sells out was spinach and blackberries. The corned beef hash and eggs was plentiful and packed with flavor. The little girls ordered bacon and eggs which came with croissant too. The bacon was so thick and yummy...don't know how they managed to get it crispy. They were like pieces of pork steak!

It's served with yogurt, milk, and fresh fruit.

One of us always orders one of the specials when we go. We always make sure to bring home some croissants or brioche for the kids to enjoy!

Excellent tomato soup, great BLT although husband would have prefered the bacon to be crispier (he didn't request that, however, and some of us like our bacon less crispy than others). The flavor of the bacon was superb. I ordered a grilled cheese...excellent cheese, but the challah bread was simply too thick...make the same sandwich but with much thinner slices of bread...the fruit and salad greens sides served with the orders were wonderful. We then returned a few days later for brunch/lunch...very crowded, but we were seated relatively quickly (staff passing out tastes of pastries made the wait far more enjoyable). Excellent omlet served with a tasty potato side, good bacon and eggs with an English muffin and a most amazing chicken salad croissant. When I told our daughter to taste the chicken salad, her response was ""I don't do things like chicken salad"" but after tasting this one, she admitted she might just change her mind.

Ordered myself the usual (never disappointing) iced chai along side (you guessed it) AVOCADO TOAST. The zest to the avocado was tasty and felt like a real pallet cleanser. Couldn't find it in myself to complain about rising avocado prices, being as though that's an actual issue, especially for businesses like the grand. Everyone's gotta profit. I don't mind. I just want the cado. Didn't bring my kid (mostly because I'm 19 and don't own one) but even if I did own a child, I'd make it a point to teach it how to drink water without making a mess AMIRITE LADIES? Any-who, sat at the big round table upstairs. It's great for students like myself, equipped with charging ports for laptop and phone! It IS Pretty wobbly but I'm more of a problem solver and just pulled the ol ""righty tighty"" on it and adjusted the wobble. I'd like to point out that Grand does an amazing job of being versatile and diverse enough to serve all walks of life. They seem to be opening up a cool new portion downstairs for sorbet, have an upstairs for studying and the outside seating is amazing scene for a night at the bar. (Or I'd assume. What do I know? I'm 19) If diversity isn't enough to sway you on over, take note that Grand continues to be one of the largest/ more spacious coffee/bar joints I've been to in the metro area.

1752,cafes_list,"I wish something like this existed around me when I was growing up. It would've affirmed that I wasn't weird and that board games and role playing games are cool. I wish I could give it more than five stars. The Malted Meeple is a wonderful place for people to come together, play board games, and drink milkshakes, craft beers, and cocktails. They have some smaller fares, like soft pretzels, soup, and shepherds pie, but they're mostly great for liquid calories. You are allowed to stay as long as you want and play all of the games you want for $5 a person, which isn't a big deal, since all of the games are upkept and in good condition. Our waiter was really great and recommended stuff on their super large menu! He was super attentive. All the staff was really kind and helpful with all of the games. While it was somewhat overwhelming, they answered all of our questions! I had a Chocolate Chip Wookie milkshake with Bailey's added and it was delicious. After a few games, I had a health potion cocktail. It was fruit flavors mixed with rum - it was super sugary and definitely wasn't as good as the milkshake. I can't wait to go back to the Malted Meeple and try more of the games and more of the milkshakes, mixed drinks, and coffee drinks. It's a great fun environment and concept. Definitely one of my new favorites in town. Just don't come expecting dinner or lunch - they don't have food food. They also have a ton of parking in front, so don't worry about that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something fun for an afternoon or evening with a few friends. So excited to come back!",5-star,positive
1753,cafes_list,"This place is so much fun! It is great to go to after dinner for games, snacks and drinks. I love how there are so many different board games I haven't even heard of. The staff is all great with helping you decide what to play and going over how to play it.",5-star,positive
1754,cafes_list,"Loved our first time here. The milkshakes were super tasty (I got the emerald ewok) - very foamy and just the right amount of lime and sweetness in mine, and I enjoyed the selection of games offered and the wide, open spacings between tables that helped with sound carry/isolating groups but making you feel like part of a community as well. It looked like a haunted house from the outside (not well lit and the entrance was out back) but it was nice and bright and open on the inside. The tables were pretty large, making it easy to play with 4 people, and the environment was pretty chill and easy-going. It would have been pretty special if the pretzels we ordered were the soft pretzel kind and not the hard, store bought kind - but I do get it, with avoiding messes on board games and all. It gets a little pricey with the cover fee + snack up charge though (so I'm not sure about Yelp's suggested one $ business) but when you go in expecting it - or if these snacks were signature in some way, it's not so bad then. Overall, I had a great time here on a Friday night. A little far from our usual travels, but we would come back again.",4-star,positive

1758,cafes_list,"Overall I loved the venue, service and chocolate milkshake. My best friend, boyfriend and I visited last Saturday afternoon and had a great time. This is only the second board game lounge I've ever been to and was pleased with the selection of games and beverages. However, there's always room for improvement. It was quite cold...and It would be nice to have a popcorn that is just plain or cheese. The only two non-sweet options were buffalo ranch and Cajun. My friend ended up with Chex mix. And a few 'party' games and nostalgic games would be welcome to break up the strat games. We did have a great time though.",4-star,positive
1759,cafes_list,"This is my third visit to The Malted Meeple, but the first time with the family. It was my wife and two children, ages 10 and 7. We went to play new games and we were not disappointed! Carrington, one of the servers was very helpful and attentive. We played four games and he help us set up and explained the rules for each game. In the excitement of a game, one of the kids accidentally knocked over their drink. Carrington was immediately over to clean up the spill. Several other group had children as well, and all appeared to having an enjoyable time. Our family had a good time and enjoyed all the games we played. The kids saw there is an early 5 - 7pm New Years Eve party and they have already asked to come to the event. We will be back to learn more new games.",5-star,positive
1760,cafes_list,Went here on a Saturday afternoon and had a lot of fun with the family. They had a lot of great games to choose from and the snacks were good. I look forward to going back!

1761,cafes_list,"I feel really torn about giving this place 4 or 3 stars. But I've decided to go the generous route, at least until I visit some other board game bars to do a comparison. We came on a Sunday shortly after they opened. Unfortunately, they don't serve alcohol on Sundays (but we knew this going in since it's clearly displayed on their website). We tried the milkshake flight (3 new flavors they're auditioning to be next month's FOM). For August it includes red velvet, brownie, and birthday cake. Honestly, they all tasted pretty much the same to me, and they were rather boring. We also got some buffalo popcorn, which was fine. I would have much rather had something more substantial to snack on, or nutritious even. But their menu options are very limited to things like popcorn, chips, candy, etc. A cheese plate or some crudités would go a long way here, in my opinion. Anyway, you don't come here for the food or drinks, you come for the games. They have a fine selection, which is organized by category. My husband had already studied their game menu online before coming (which he said is a huge plus for this place compared to other game board bars), so we knew what we wanted to play and didn't really do much browsing. I would think that the ease-of-browsing/selecting makes a big difference in your overall experience (like it would at a bookstore or library), so my review is lacking in that aspect. Overall I'd say this place is great just because I love the idea of a board game bar. But it's also the only one I've been to, so I can't say if it's better or worse than the other options in the area.",4-star,positive
1762,cafes_list,"Quick planning details for you: -They don't serve meals, just snacks, so plan to eat before/after you go. -Can't bring in outside food either (e.g. pizza). Rules could be different if you're setting up a formal event with them; didn't do this, so not sure. -Can bring your own games. -Will loan out their games. Great venue for hanging out to play games with friends, or trying out some new games. 4 of my friends and I brought in Firefly last Friday night after dinner and played from 7-11, and everybody had fun. We were able to walk right in and grab a table. The place got busier as the night got later; there was just 1 other group when we first arrived, but it was almost full when we left. Atmosphere is basically like a geeky gaming/comics shop that conveniently also has a bar. This is in contrast with other ""bar-first"" gaming places which are bars that also conveniently have games. If you are looking for a hipstery or edgy bar scene that does games, this is probably not your place. Even though we brought our own, they have an awesome selection of games. List is on their website. Noise-level was great for playing games, throughout the night. At its busiest, it grew to be about on par with a typical sit-down restaurant. There is not music, TVs, or kitchen noise to talk over either, which helps. I had never played Firefly before, so needed the rules explained and had questions while playing, and never had to ask my friends to repeat themselves because of noise. Crowd was mostly 20-30 somethings, but there was also a family that brought kids, and a group with some older adults, so the place seems friendly for all ages. As another reviewer pointed out, it was not all men either. Food-wise, I had a delicious ""Dagoba Swamp"" milkshake, which was basically Oreos, vanilla ice cream, and mint blended together, with an awesome piece of half un-blended Oreo at the ""bottom of the swamp"". Milkshakes also come in an $18 mega size, which is about the size of a small fish bowl. $18 seemed a little too high for what it was, so I did not order one myself. We also ordered pretzels and buffalo popcorn, and the portion size was pretty generous for both - good for about 2/3 people. Chocolate truffles were good but very tiny, probably not worth the $2 a piece. Having waiters is really nice for a place like this. Really great not to have to leave the game to go to the bar to get another drink or snacks and then have to wait until your drink is ready to return. Only negative about the experience is that a few of us felt bugged a bit to buy drinks by one of the waiters, which was disruptive to our game. It wasn't a huge deal, but given that there is a $5 table fee per person, and that most of us were regularly ordering stuff, it felt a bit unneeded. I think checking if we need anything, and moving on if we decline, is enough; no need to persist. I imagine this is just a kink that will get ironed out after they're in business a while. Definitely don't let it stop you from coming. All-in-all we had a really great time though, and definitely plan to return again!",4-star,positive
1763,cafes_list,"Before we went my wife made both of us a dinner of salmon burgers grilled with terriyaki and served with waffle cut fries. They were amazing and our cat begged way too much salmon of us, but I couldn't blame him as it was quite tasty. After dinner was over she agreed to come with me to visit a new gaming cafe in the area, The Malted Meeple. I say in the area loosely, but the greater Cleveland/Akron area is a big area and it was a bit of a drive. Not knowing what kind of games they would have I brought some smaller games for two players along. When we got down there we found the place, though it is a bit set back from the road and I highly suggest looking up its location before you go. Upon entering we were greeted by a nice host, who explained to us there was a five dollar table fee, but other than that you need pay nothing else. He did mention they had a variety of snack foods, shakes, and craft beer. I started out with a water and my wife got a wheat ale. I inspected their game library and noticed that though they had well over a hundred games in their collection, including lots of games I either enjoy or would love to play, they did not have many for two players that were more gamerly. Most of their more interesting games were in the 3-5 player region and felt geared toward groups of that number. Luckily, as I mentioned previously, I had brought some games of my own. We started out with a game of Star Realms, which my wife handily won. While we were playing Star Realms, the host came by with a flight of shakes, similar to a flight of beer, he was showing off. They were the Degeva, the Hoth, and the Tatooine Twist. Once we were finished playing Star Realms we ordered a flight of shakes for ourselves. The Tatooine Twist was sweet and had and orange flavor in it, my wife described it as a orange creamsicle. It was suggested it went with something spicy, like some buffalo popcorn they apparently sold, but having eaten earlier we passed on it. My wife, however, did agree it needed to be paired with something spicy. The Hoth was a malt shake with a subtle spice in it that was really smooth, and Degeva was a cookies and cream with a nice minty flavor. We liked all of them although my favorite was the Hoth and my Lady was most taken by Degeva. The repast being consumed we decided to try another game I had brought, which we both learned on the spot, Biblios. It was a game with some really interesting drafting mechanics and although my wife won, we both agreed that this is one we wanted to play again. I think it has far more depth than it first seems to and it proved quite interesting. When we started setting up our next game, Gravwell, the waiter came by and asked if they could get us anything. We ordered a Mayan Truffle for each of us and received them only a little bit into the game of Gravwell. The truffle was the deep chocolate taste you would expect from a truffle with just a hint of spice at the end, which was a nice touch. That was the finish of a very nice gaming day for me. As far as the Malted Meeple goes I was left with a overall good impression, though I would stress certain points for it. If you go, I would go with a group of three of more. For a smaller group I'm not certain their game library really supports that, unless you bring games of your own. The second point is that this place does not serve lunch or dinner, only snacks. If you are likely to get hungry I would suggest eating before you go. Since this is a game cafe I should probably comment on the tables. They are large with glass surfaces and a raised ridge. While I would have preferred a cloth surface with a bit more texture for traction, the glass surface was not a huge problem. One nice feature was the raised edges of the table, making it harder for dice or cards to slide off of them. These are the only negatives though, and I'm not sure if my comments on the table are not somewhere in between, rather than being a negative. They have tons of good games in their library for 3-5 player groups and from what I could see of the other tables the staff seems to have some familiarity with the games. I did not get to personally ask them to teach a game, but I may make a point of doing so at some point in the future. A big positive for me was the environment and the staff. The feel of the place left one feeling gaming was a refined activity for adults and young adults. It was very welcoming to dates and women and there were, in fact, a number of women there. This paired with an extensive snack and craft brew menu left one feeling they could spend hours here in mixed company or with more casual gamers and everyone could walk away remembering the experience very favorably. Overall I was impressed and for the groups I described, I will likely go here in the future.",4-star,positive

1765,cafes_list,"What an adorable quaint cafe just north of High Park. This super clean and chill space is quite nice for someone to sit and relax with a cup. Though it isn't big, there is enough seating for at least 15 people without being completely overcrowded. It helps the front space is pretty generous. The tables here are all nicely clean and well organized. They had some latin beats playing to a very quiet cafe. Though there was maybe 4 other people, it feel so still. Service here is polite and attentive with a helpful attitude in case you had questions. I saw a lot of people arrive to just do take out of food or a drink and each time they were greeted quickly with a smile. Flat White - I was glad to see Propeller coffee beans served here. With the Turbo (darker roast), I knew the flavour would be richer than the one I had experienced. I found the flat white to be decent but it was really more of a latte as it had a lot of milk to dilute the espresso shot. It's a good latte flavour but definitely missing the boldness of a true flat white. 3/5 Chocolate Madeleine cookies - Made in house, these were the texture of a super rich brownie. So for all those who love a fudgey brownie texture, this would be good for you. As for flavour, it had a super bold bitter dark chocolate taste. A very rich cocoa with very little sweetness. I found it a perhaps too bitter for a cookie since I was asking which of their baked good was the sweetness. Still a great texture ... just could have used a tad more sweet to balance the cocoa. 3/5 Nice little neighbourhood spot for those who don't want the crowds and a decent cup. Helps that the service here is the right touch.",3-star,negative

They were also super accommodating with a last minute sandwich order for a wedding. They managed to grill everything, package them into shareable quarters, and still be fresh by the time we picked them up. Everyone loved the flavour and options, and tried a little bit of everything.

I inhaled deeply, sensing the eyes of a nearby infant on my supple face. I turned to the miniature person, ready to toss it a bonbon, as per uge, when I noticed the font of the menu script. It was pleasing. An interesting choice for a coffee shop, not one I would choose personally, but I appreciated the boldness. Very avant garde. My gaze moved to the food display, arranged alphabetically. Ordering coffee, I applied my knowledge of grinds, inquiring on soaking time of the beans prior to caffein immersion.

It's a small little place, maybe 30 seats or so, but it's meant for a quick lunch break bite or so. Ownership of this place changed quite few times throughout the years, and current owner did it the best in my opinion. They revamped the menu and tweaked their best items to make them even better. They have a website that they update every single day with the day's soup and hot main items which change everyday to give you that variety and break the routine of a fixed menu.

1780,cafes_list,"One of my colleagues and I used the Mission Eatery for catering purposes back in the summer. The first time I ordered just the Cold Sandwich/Wrap Combo for about 20 people or so. I wasn't really impressed as (1) there were no wraps and (2) the sandwiches were on Wonder-type bread with some non-appetizing luncheon meats. The second time my colleague ordered some mini muffins for a breakfast. I can't speak for the rest of the staff or myself as I've never tried them but she said they were not very good. The third time I tried to order Chicken Marsala but I was told that I didn't reach the minimum order. This wasn't an issue as I told them I would just use another caterer but keep them in mind for next time. Then I got calls back indicating that they would cater the Chicken Marsala but I would have to pay a fee as the order was too small. I ended up getting some staff together to pitch in so we didn't have to pay a premium. Well, when it arrived, there were all types of hidden costs that they didn't indicate over the phone. To add insult to injury, the Chicken Marsala was an unseasoned thick piece of chicken breast with what tasted to be Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup on top. Needless to say, that did NOT go over well with staff. The word used to describe it was, ""gross."" Needless to say, we found another caterer.",2-star,negative

I def know where to go around the airport next time!,5-star,positive
1799,cafes_list,"The food (if you can even call it that), at the airport is dismal, barely edible, not very fresh and completely over-priced. Mission Eatery is hidden away in an office building on Airport Road - it's called Airway Park (there are blue signs), 4 buildings, and it's super close to the gas stations and the intersection / stoplight. This place is amazing, and I'm so happy that I finally went here after so many disappointing meals either by the airport, or in the airport. This is definitely 5 stars - affordable prices, healthy, fresh foods that make you feel like you went to your parents' house for a meal. They have their regular menu and 3-4 specials that are written on a chalkboard (and also on their website). The prices are reasonable too - I got soup and my salad for just about $10, which is what you would pay at the airport for some mediocre, bland salad. I got a delicious broccoli lentil soup that was hearty and healthy (just pureed vegetables and lentils), with a hint of curry. It tasted homemade (I imagine it was), and was perfect to battle the cold outside. The kale salad was good too - with cabbage, avocado, almonds & dried cranberry. There was a little bit too much dressing on there for my taste, but I should've gotten it on the side. Great customer service too - everyone was super friendly and nice. And when the cashier discovered I was going to dine-in, she came over to my table and brought me silverware. Complete with a smile and some nice chit-chat - these basic things are often not found elsewhere. All in all, a perfect place to come either right after you land or before you take off, or if you stay by the airport frequently. I'll definitely be back here again. I'd recommend to anyone traveling into or out of Toronto.",5-star,positive

1801,cafes_list,"This restaurant is the absolute epitome of 5 Stars! While staying at a nearby hotel during a brief overnight layover, I had the privilege of visiting with Ms. Lanny Liu, the owner and head chef of this quaint establishment. To date, they have been open for approx 2 months, so they are just getting started. Thats not so say, however, that Ms. Liu is just getting started. As we spoke, it became evident that the crazy good food was not a mere accident or anomaly. She's been doing this a while and it shows. When I think of 5 Stars, I don't think of high dollar, fancy, or lobster...I think of fresh ingredients, creative dishes, unique bold flavors, and lastly but perhaps most importantly, it has to be executed with precision. That is EXACTLY what I found at The Mission Eatery. With a variety of meals, from the hearty meaty, to the hearty vegan, there is a fit for everyone. Although I am not a vegan, I was lured into the vegan portobello mushroom and cheddar melt. It was absolutely fantastic. For a small add on price, I got their Mission salad. Perfectly balanced with a variety of ingredients and dressing (again, they nailed it with the dressing...not too dry, but not at all soggy). For years, I used to avoid getting stuck at this layover during a lunch or dinner meal time. With the addition of this fantastic place, that fear is gone and replaced with the anticipation of returning to try another delicious creation. VERY WELL DONE! PS. The service and staff is perhaps the most friendly I have encountered in quite some time.",5-star,positive

The smoked salmon croissant is just AMAZING. And the best part is that everything, yes I mean everything, is made in house. I was so surprised to hear that the pickled onions and even the dressing on my sandwich is home made. You can tell that the owner is a true chef that is really passionate about her food!

1804,cafes_list,"A few friends and I finally made it down with our bicycles to spend the day touring the islands on wheels, with the highlight supposed to be an apres at the Rectory Cafe. While we passed it both around the front and the back during the ride, we saw many empty tables and looked forward to a leisurely late lunch/early dinner when we were done. Wrong! We locked up our bikes and went in. There was no line-up, and I didn't even register that we were being turned away - there would be about an hour wait, they weren't serving in the dining room inside, and other people would be arriving for their reservations. Reservations? The entire indoor dining room empty and off limits, and dozens of tables outside sitting fallow. The few tables that were being used for service were indeed occupied, but sucks to be you if you don't book a serviced table in advance. This is the precious cafe that threatened they would have to close during the beginning of the soggy season because people weren't still coming to the islands, even though they were open during the spring flood? They wanted a handout from the city because they're not busy enough when it suits them? This was the first long weekend since the flooding that the islands were fully open, with beautiful weather and an opportunity to make up for the dire lack of business. But, they still prefer to turn people away because they can't be bothered to service all their tables and the customers should know better, you should have booked earlier and said you'd come back. I'd rather go to establishments where the customers are the reason they're in business, not the other way around. Keep your snot.

We ordered hot chocolate and hot water, with the waiter giving us a surprised look at the latter, like we didn't order enough. The drinks took a long time and when it can it was simply two small coffee mugs both of which had dirty, visible stains on the outside. To boot, my hot chocolate was barely 75% of the mug full, and tasted like powdered beverage. The bill came to $6.12, complete with $1 for the hot water. What is this, sub-par service and below quality food at overcharged price just to be a snub to patrons warming up after enjoying an afternoon on the Island?",1-star,negative
1806,cafes_list,"I've been to the Rectory a few times and had food ranging from mediocre to quite good but the service today left me deeply disappointed - enough to write this review. Came with a friend visiting from Germany for a light dinner. Chalkboard by main entrance indicated that today's soup was potato and cheddar soup, which given that it was raining seemed like a great idea - so when our waiter came, I ordered ""the soup, please"" as the menu lists ""Daily Soup"" for $7. I was surprised when my soup arrived to find a chilled fruit soup. I flagged down the waiter immediately and said that although I had indeed ordered ""the soup"", their sign said it was potato and cheddar. He assured me that I was mistaken and that the only soup on offer was this chilled watermelon soup. My friend and I were both confused as we'd both read the chalkboard by the door when we came in and were quite certain we had not misread ""watermelon"" as ""potato and cheddar""... Our waiter (to his credit) asked if I'd like to order something else, which I didn't as my friend was already eating her meal and we'd ordered soup and a salad because we were trying to catch a ferry back in only 45 minutes (as they're hourly from Ward's Island). He said he would ""go take a look at the sign"" and I assumed he would go, find that we were indeed right, and report back, presumably comping the mistaken soup. We didn't see him again until he brought us the cheque, featuring my soup at full price. I went to investigate and sure enough, he had located the incorrect sign and changed it to say ""Watermelon Soup (COLD)"". Given that it was raining and I was having only soup for dinner, watermelon soup was really not ideal. I've worked as a waiter for several years and I was surprised to find that my rather unsatisfying cold soup dinner had not been comped given that the error was clearly theirs. I was also surprised that the waiter did not return to confirm that I was indeed right, and apologize for accusing me of being wrong about what their own sign said. The watermelon soup came with, somewhat confusingly, a solitary, savoury breadstick. I think I'll give another restaurant a try next time I'm on the islands. As for my dinner tonight, I took the ferry home in the rain and made myself spaghetti.",2-star,negative

We Arrived today at 3:45pm knowing the kitchen closes in 45 minutes, first massively nice day at the island this year, we got in a line for a table. We were 8th person in line. Servers told us to be patient they were cleaning tables (plenty looked available). We waited 30 minutes in line before someone actually told the whole line that they were shutting the whole kitchen down at 4:30pm and basically they would only serve 4 more people at the front of the line, they literally didn't want to seat people who had waited in line for 30 minutes beside the fact the kitchen was open for a while.?!?! Why could no staff member have told us that while they say us waiting in line for so long? Eventually like 20 people were in line. shutting down early they turned away a ton of people.

Won't bother trying to go back.",1-star,negative
1814,cafes_list,"I'm willing to admit that I didn't have high expectations going in, because the Rectory Cafe doesn't have much competition out there on the islands. If you don't want to eat dripping fast food while top 40 blares in the background, then it's the RC. But I was surprised. On two counts. 1) the chef has put together a limited but agreeable menu that has something for everyone, and the kitchen cares enough to present this food in its best and most appetizing arrangements. I would describe the food as unexciting, but pleasing. But then again, maybe I would have enjoyed it more if my dining hadn't been spoiled by... 2) the worst service I have ever encountered. Our server resentfully greeted us from behind mirrored sunglasses and was annoyed by a question about the brisket burger (""look, do you know what brisket is? - sigh - It's just your basic hamburger""),. She then took our order and sent someone else out to deliver food we hadn't ordered. She told us, on her way past the table, that she had punched in the wrong meals and we would need to wait. No apology. Twenty minutes later when my friend asked if we could have some bread, she said ""it's only a few more minutes,"" again, without stopping and without apology. Another ten minutes passes. Note here that others are getting what we ordered, so I assume she didn't care to tell the kitchen we were waiting for an order she screwed up. Finally she brings out the meal with a ""here it is"" and walks away. And proceeds to avoid being near our table until we are finished. Mistakes happen. I dined out a few weeks ago at a place where the server forgot to bring us things and made an error in the order. He came over to tell us of his error and apologize. The moment we met our server at the RC, I commented to my friend that she seemed quite terse for someone working in a tourist location. I didn't guess it was going to go from terse to hostile. Maybe she's been banished to that island as some kind of sentence. The other servers seemed better. They at least got food to the table and made eye contact.

We shared sandwiches and she anticipated our need for extra plates. We had calamari and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were very good.

I've only ever had one other bad dining experience since living in Toronto but this place really takes the biscuit. First of all I went here with my family whom were visiting from Ireland and decided to take them to Toronto island, ward island in particular. We walked around quite a bit and decided to go for a nice lunch and we seen the Rectory Cafe. Its has a really nice patio but that's about it. There was a fuss from the very beginning because there were 9 of us. They discussed in front of us what they were going to do with us like it was a major issue. We were seated by the rudest server I have ever met in my life. He was extremely short and impatient. Firstly my partner asked for a different bun with his burger as he doesn't like pretzel buns and wanted a basic bun but was told that if he changes one thing he would have to change it for others and it would be a major inconvenience to the kitchen... this place wasn't even half full and i am sure changing a bun isn't a big deal. I then asked for a gluten free bun and was told simply no in a short answer and left kinda sitting there... He was extremely smug.. then he continued down the table with short outbursts of rudeness until the final order came FROM my partners father....The waiter said if he was not ready to order he had other things to do and he was busy... Now when i say my partners father took literally 10 seconds to pick what he wanted that's all he took... Everyone look at him and were horrified by his rudeness... I turned to him and asked him was he being serious and told him he was extremely rude and we came to enjoy a nice lunch and he basically ruined it. He then asked if I would like another server and I replied yes...This man was also the manager and even what I have described above doesn't even describe or cover the rudeness I experienced. The next server was pretty nice and she even smiled.... but brought our drinks orders at the end of the meal but she took them from our bill which was appreciated.

We were seated promptly and given menus however we sat there for at least 30 minutes watching patrons who arrived later than us getting served and getting their food before our orders were even taken. My boyfriend and I were starting to get impatient and were trying to think of polite ways to wave somebody down. The staff made eye contact with him but did not approach us. Finally someone walked past us and we advised them we were ready to order. The hostess seemed annoyed and said our server will be with us shortly. Minutes go by, nobody. A server helping some customers that came after us noticed we seemed ready, smiled at us and said someone will be right with us. Again, minutes later and still nobody. My boyfriend remarked that there were several staff members hovering over one particular lady at her table. Then I overheard the same hostess that sat us down earlier tell some people that were walking in that the kitchen was closed. So was I just going to wait almost an hour just only to be told that I can't have the food that I came to the restaurant for? Some of the worst, most disorganized and careless service I've ever received. Frustrated, my boyfriend and I walked out and headed to The Island Cafe. Boy were we glad we went there! It was a cute little place, very warm relaxed atmosphere - we were sat, served and fed all within 15 minutes! They even had vegan options, much to my delight. In a way, I'm glad I had this experience here. The food seemed overpriced and judging by a lot of reviews, it is definitely not worth the high price tag. Also, we got to experience the loveliness of The Island Cafe! It's sad to see that this restaurant doesn't care to lose thousands of dollars (based on what has been said here on Yelp).

They have a full bar, although I don't think that's advertised on their web site. The staff are very friendly and appear to get along well. I had the vegetable curry after the server said the chef is Indian. It was pretty good but not as good as what I'd get from a decent Indian restaurant...but I wasn't at a decent Indian restaurant! It was a tad pricey at $24 but I would definitely go back to try more dishes. Hubby had the mussels and received a huge portion that would have fed 2-3 folks. He liked it. The chef was kind enough to prepare the youngest an off menu grilled cheese and fries since that's what she was craving. #1 had the lemon garlic chicken and said it was good. One of the servers let the kiddos pick candy from the candy case and gave us the last piece of coconut cream pie in the glass pie dish. The servers probably sized us up as generous tourists and chatted with us about what we had been doing since arriving in Toronto. Dining out is always more enjoyable when the restaurant staff appear to like each other and their jobs. Kudos to the staff for making us feel at home!",4-star,positive

1839,cafes_list,Cute little diner. Has a variety of diner food. Good for brunch but go early as it fills up and there is no room to wait indoors. There is not a lot of space in the restaurant and most tables are booths so there is a limit to the size of party that can be accommodate. Service is attentive when its not busy.

1840,cafes_list,"Over-priced for dinner. The website still has a review touting the top chef, but our server said he left years ago and it shows. $16 crab cakes were two cold and mushy mouthfuls on a wilted piece of romaine lettuce. $12 ""roasted"" beet salad was four or five slices straight from the jar with two forkfuls of goat cheese on limp greens. $32 steak came with limp ""frites"" that were actually shoestring fries, and unseasoned steamed vegetables. It may be good for a diner breakfast, but there are literally hundreds of better dinner options within a kilometre.",1-star,negative
1841,cafes_list,"I went here for brunch on a Sunday, and the bottom dining area of The Senator was packed, but the lounge (upstairs) had lots of space. The lounge has a different brunch menu than the restaurant (more French-inspired) and also had a more European/French feel that my friends and I really enjoyed. The lounge brunch was fantastic and the staff were so phenomenal and so nice that I would love to come back! One of my friends had the ""Tempered Room"" Croissant Sandwich as is, and another had it with no meat/cheese and they were so nice that they put portobello mushrooms inside the one without meat (they both looked delicious and received rave reviews)! Myself and another friend had Le Continental and it was so good! Finally, another one of my friends ordered the Croque Forestiere, it did not come out with the rest of our meals, as there had been some sort of issue in the kitchen, but the staff were so fantastic that they brought out a salad for her while she waited for her sandwich (which still came with the side salad when it arrived), gave her a discount on her meal, and gave her a voucher for a baked good from the case in the main dining area downstairs! Honestly, it was one of the best brunch experiences I have ever had! 10/10",5-star,positive

A few caveats - we dined exclusively during the week, when it was never really crowded - i'm assuming that quite a line develops with the weekend brunch crowd, especially considering it location right outside the square. Everything we ordered, from the baked goods to the eggs, pancakes, bacon, etc., was delicious, seemed reasonably priced for the location, and came out quickly. My one qualm is that my wife got the last banana nut muffin, and we came in the next day and they still had not replenished - i left Toronto still wanting to try that muffin!

When in Rome...we both decided to order the Senator breakfast. Baked beans for breakfast?? Sure, it's a little unusual, but the meal was good, and chased with a hearty mug with The Senator logo on it filled with stout coffee from a local supplier, Dark City Coffee, it hit the spot.

1854,cafes_list,"This was a post-TFC downtown Yelp-search find the other day while looking for some quick diner food. When we first got there our priorities were more along the lines of WASHROOM! WASHROOM!, but once we took care of that we were more than a little intrigued by this busy, but well staffed diner. The menu is pretty brief with 6-10 each of apps, mains, and dessert, but everything looked good and there wasn't a lot of overlap in terms of types of foods/flavours. The restaurant itself is also pretty cool with old coke machines and napkin dispensers, lots of wood everywhere and some cool artwork on the walls. Has a classic feel to it without feeling old. I had the braised beef short rib on a bed of mashed potatoes with some julienned carrots and parsnips(?) on the side all surrounded by an incredibly flavourful gravy. The worst thing I can say about this dish is that there WASN'T ENOUGH! Haha. The beef just fell apart, the mashed potatoes and gravy were great and even the veggies on the side left me wanting more. It was also pretty perfectly portioned and plated. Not too big, but more than filling and it made me hungry just to look at it. My buddy Phil's burger looked pretty awesome too. Big and greasy. And, until I tasted my dish, I was a little jealous! Next time... Also, it was pretty packed and we were lucky to get seated as fast as we did, so make reservations if you're planning on going during prime hours. If I lived a little closer or was going to school at Ryerson, I could see this place becoming a regular hangout. There's nothing wrong with a shorter menu if everything is top notch. I'll definitely come back in the future.",5-star,positive

JYB had the tuna melt and butternut squash soup. I don't do tuna, but it looked solid, and the soup was bold harvest flavours. Great spot for lunch in the downtown core.

1856,cafes_list,"I am a sucker for history! Plus psychology, anthropology, archaeology, astronomy, sociology, palaeontology, pathology, and of course, gastronomy... OKAY... so I digress, the point is: I like the fact The Senator is Toronto's oldest diner and because of it, I really, really, R-E-A-L-L-Y wanted to like it. Alas, this locale, sans it's picturesque history is nothing more than average. I took someone here a few weeks ago, and granted the place is cute in that 1960's kinda decour but her Eggs Benedict were, well, atrocious. The recipe was just badly executed and it tasted salty and sour. The Hollandaise if it could be called that was sub par at best. She is really too nice a person (don't know why) to send it back and so we shared some of my French Toasts which unfortunately were so sweet that I am still waiting for the Type 2 Diabetes to hit me like a Mack truck...you know, any day now. Their egg dishes are average at best. Sure they are not bad but I had the same quality at Jonny G's or The Coach House but for 40% less. I attended a Yelp event here a few days ago and again, the decour is very good. I find it charming and spot on but not enough to loose your head over. However the food, although well intentioned was still just okay. Their crab cakes tasted a bit better than store bought and as far as their Mac and Cheese, my companion said she could easily make better. Sliders were good but not exceptional. So all in all, the restaurant suffers specially when you pick up a menu and compare their prices to the competition. Oh Senator, I appreciate they open silly-early in the morning, you know, for a real breakfast however in the end, the major factor is the food and why come here when you will get the same quality at multiple other places less than a 15 minute walk for less? Okay, maybe those other places may not have opened in 1929... but I can live with that. At least, I will really enjoy my eggs Benny then.",3-star,negative

1858,cafes_list,"I truly adore this place. Only wish I lived closer. The atmosphere is amazing. It's bustling on a weekday lunch. Smiling faces, engaged conversations, servers walking up and down the aisles, a small line of people waiting at the front for their tables, expensive looking espresso maker at front..... The place is filled with large and small booths, dark wood panels, and dim lighting. I would describe the Senator as a classy diner. They have a big menu but I settled for the Senator breakfast which came with 2 eggs, challah toast, 5 slices of bacon, potatoes, beans, and coffee. All this for $8! An excellent breakfast deal. Let me tell you a secret. This is the best diner coffee I have ever had. Seriously - you need to try this. My over medium eggs were perfect with just a bit of runny yolk and not overdone. Challah toast was slightly sweet and delicious!!! I could eat 10 slices if they gave it to me. Service was super friendly but super slow. I had the time but I saw some customers wait a long time for their order and couldn't even enjoy it when it did come because they needed to get back to work. Not the place to come for lunch if you have an hour lunch break. Because it literally took 45 minutes for the food to come after the order. I didn't mind though. This is the place to come to enjoy great food at great prices with great company. Or if you don't have company, you can easily strike conversations with people around you. Some of their booths are awfully close to one another. My booth was literally side by side with a couple of guys and I could hear their entire conversation. I was super happy after lunch. My only regret is, why did it take me so long to discover this place? Once again, thanks Yelpers!",5-star,positive

Decor and pricing was average, although I highly recommend the waiters for being so attentive and offering to take photos for us when he saw me pull out a camera for this review. So either it's overrated, or we ordered food that was just so-so. We ordered : - Senator Breakfast ... Bacon & Eggs with Challah Toast, Beans, & Home Fries, Tea or Coffee Before 11:30am $7.95 After 11:30am $9.95 - Huevos Rancheros with Black Beans, Tomato Salsa, Avocado & Homemade Corn Bread $10.95 Looks and tastes like ordinary breakfast from other places.

1862,cafes_list,"First place I became a ""regular"" at in Toronto. Probably mostly (but not entirely) because it was the first place in Toronto I had a crush on one of the waitresses. The breakfasts here are great- I'd usually go early morning before the rush, grab the standard Senator breakfast with 2 eggs, meat, beans, etc, etc. Coffee usually quite nice- as is the challah bread used for toast. (7.95 if you get there early enough) My other fav breakfast menu item was the ""yogurt surprise"" which (you'll likely be happy to know) is not what it sounds like. It's actually just yogurt and fruit and granola. (10.95) At lunch, go for a sandwich- they're all pretty good but I found the best to be: Cubano: Slow Roasted Pork Loin, Avocado, Tomato, Chipotle Mayo on Sourdough (10.95) Dinner: The menu gets pricier/fancier, so I'd usually just stick with the Senator Burger: 8 oz Cumbrae Naturally Raised Beef, Served with Sauteed Onions, Tomato, Lettuce, With Fries or Green Salad @ $14. --- Overall, it's a good spot. The atmosphere and waitstaff are great. The real problem is that it's gets up there in price- so if you're a habitual breakfast eater-outer, it'll put a lil' more of a dent in your wallet than 2 McDonald's breakfast burritos.",4-star,positive

The barrista was very friendly, they serve cold water and they have free wifi. They were also playing some nice easy rock music at a low level. It's quite relaxing and quiet. My major problem with the place was that it was SO COLD. I don't know if they turned the heat down because it's been mild lately, but on a snowy morning, this coffee shop was far from warm and cozy.

The Tampered Press is a cozy space dominated by a large communal table with a quiet bookstore vibe. On my very first visit, I managed to score a table with an outlet. Plugs seem far and few between here, but they do have wifi which kept me occupied for many hours in this enclave. A community group took over the big table later on in the evening, suggesting this spot has a solid connection to the locals. Definitely seems like a neighbourhood coffeshop.

1892,cafes_list,"""This doesn't feel like Toronto."" she excitedly whispered as we walked in the door. And truly it doesn't feel like Toronto, there is a hushed vibe as you walk in the door. No quirky lamps or pretentious decorations. Just a warm comfy place to drink a coffee and take a moment. The shelves that line the walls are full of books, journals and water bottles, inviting you to take a look and think a little more about what you put in your body. The idea of earth/body consciousness also fills the barista menu, where there are several freshly squeezed juices and earth friendly brand choices. As the last official stop on the coffee crawl this was a welcome addition, and as I was already quaking with caffeine I opted for a San Pellegrino. At $2.50 it wasn't cheap for the tiny bottle, but after buying a flat of them at Costco I realize they are not cheap in general. Several other Yelpers opted for the fresh juices; the likes of grapefruit, pear ginger, raspberry lemon iced tea, and orange I think. We then crowded around a communal table and enjoyed each others company. This was the only place that really fit our big group and they made us feel so welcome. Bottom line...sweet and simple this shop is scrumptious, and I will definitely be back.",4-star,positive

The space has some window seating and a few tables, not a big location and no comfy chairs/fireplace like some of the newly-renovated ones, but it's clean, and the staff were quick and on the ball, even though it was a weekend. I only had to ask for my receipt once and the coffee was spot on. The napkin dispensers were visible, and full! Washrooms were also clean and both the hot and cold water feeds for the faucet worked, with decent water pressure! No burnt, frozen, or barely washed hands! When we returned from our outing at 2:00 p.m., I was still thinking about how good this morning's coffee tasted, so I came back in for another. I also ordered a fruit chill and immediately was asked whether I'd like a tray for the more-than-one beverage order. Coffee tasted just as good the second time around (and the washroom was still clean, too). (Forgot to ask BF what he thought of his fruit chill but no complaints so I figure it was fine.) If I wanted to be really picky, I'd minus a star for the lack of upper scale decor that the newly renovated locations have, but given what they have to work with, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the efficiency and proper coffee-brewing by the staff earn it the full star rating, at least for today.",5-star,positive

Now, it's an assembly line with big screen TVs and the least attentive staff in the world. But, that's not my issue here. It has to do with packaging and waste. Tim Hortons, you simply blow me away with your waste. My order was a soup and sandwich combo. The soup comes in a small waxed cardboard bowl with a plastic lid. This is placed into a waxed paper bag. The sandwich is wrapped in waxed paper, then placed into another bag and then put in the bag with the soup. To eat the soup you need a spoon and I guess a knife for some reason. These GET THEIR OWN BAG and are placed inside the first bag. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This will most likely be the only negative review I ever write. But you've got bad environmental karma Tim Hortons.

It's just become a joke. Tonight I decided to stop by to grab a quick bite, and what a raging disappointment! I ordered a flat bread only to be told ""uhh hold on we are almost out of everything for food."" Poor inventory or laziness on the part of prep? I'm not sure, but both are unacceptable. Kris ran a VERY tight ship and to see it be so poorly managed at this time is upsetting to say the least. The kid who was behind the drive through window was in a camo shirt and jeans and the other girl there was in a SUPER DIRTY TSC shirt and was just standing there on her phone. It was sort of close to close so I can understand standing around, IF ALL THE SIDE AND CLOSING WORK WAS DONE which even from the drive thru window was obviously not, given the stacked dishes at the end of the smoothie line. Who is watching the tapes? Who is managing? Who bmp is in charge, because it starts at the top... If this place isn't cleaned up and back to shipshape soon it won't last. (Like the last time I was dined in and no one came out to greet the fomront of the house for easily 5 minutes and there were people waiting there before me 2 of which left in a rage) Tropical Smoothie is a chain, franchise or not, there are standards, rules, and a name to uphold.(two stars since the food, which was an impromptu mash up of menu items since they were out of so much, was hot and the kid was at least nice.)",2-star,negative

I wanted to show my friend my favorite smoothie place - I started going to the one on Ann because this one sucks. I decided I would just give it another chance because it's been a few months and I don't know about you, but I feel like a professional establishment should give a shit about the kind of reviews they get on Yelp. Anyway, the first time we went back was about a week ago. We ordered two ultimate clubs (one with no Parmesan cheese or chipotle mayo, pretty simple, right?), and some kind of berry smoothie. We got to the window and paid right away. It then took almost 20 minutes to just get two sandwiches and a smoothie. This is not okay! I didn't want to have to speak to a manager, but I asked and talked to Kai. I believe that is how you spell her name? It rhymes with Tai, I do apologize, I should've gotten the spelling. She said she was there to fix the issues with it being slow. She said come back and lunch is on her, she told me not to give up and I was super excited because I love the food and smoothies here. Soooo, I was feeling really good about that. She made us feel like we were going to get taken care of. Today, we went back to get some yummy lunch. I asked if Kai was there and she asked me to pull up to the window. She seemed kind of annoyed, but I didn't really mind that. I put our orders in and we still waited almost another 15-20 minutes for the sandwiches and smoothie(s). We had ordered one but she was nice and threw in another one. Mind you, we still didn't want the Parmesan or chipotle mayo on one of the sandwiches and we explained that. When we got home to check the sandwiches, both sandwiches didn't have the Parmesan or mayo on them. My friend found a hair in the middle of her sandwich so stopped eating it. I don't know. It was just a straight up disaster. I'm never going back to this location. Sorry for the long story, but I wanted to explain that we weren't being terribly complicated yet it still took forever and when we came back the second time, Kai didn't seem very enthused. I get that you may have bad days, but I work in a restaurant too, you get paid to have a smile on your face. If she would've apologized again for having our food take just as long, it could've made a difference. There's no point in having me come back to try and make things better by making them way worse... And doing the same thing... But why did my sandwich have to be wrong :( Good luck, guys.

Okay fine, we'll wait since we asked before we even ordered if they had slaw. Then, amazingly, she comes back a few minutes later to tell us they don't have the dressing to make the slaw, so we'd only be getting apple and kale. We just asked for our money back.

The girl turned to look at her, and without a word simply turned back to her drawer and continued counting. To be perfectly honest, it was one of the rudest experiences, and the poorest example of customer service I've ever experienced. No ""I'll be with you in 60 seconds, nothing."" Regardless of what you are doing, when a customer walks in, your attention should be on them, and with three people working, the customer shouldn't just be standing at the counter for three straight minutes with no interaction.

One important note: They automatically add Turbinado (sweetener) to all smoothies, unless it states that Splenda is used. This is written in super fine print at the bottom of the menu.

1952,cafes_list,I hate living so close to this place because it's always tempts me so... These smoothies probably aren't healthy but they are delicious nonetheless! You can add protein to any smoothie too which makes me feel a little less guilty about drinking this monstrous smoothie. They only have one size which is probably a large but my sister and I asked that they split my last smoothie and they happily did so. I'm sad their pumpkin pie smoothie is leaving but I'll be back to the tasty beat smoothie! It tastes sort of menthol-y which is weird but i love it. I'd recommend joining the text alerts so you know if it's a buy one get one day or not. And they have happy hour Monday-Friday from 2-5 (may wanna check yourself) buy one get one free! I love it here,5-star,positive

My second drink I wanted a yogurt blend & chose the Get Up and Goji. It's like a nice refreshment at the beach. Light & tangy & sweet with the lil fullness of yogurt.

So I start thinking, it cost roughly 10 bucks for all my ingredients and about 45 min of my time to produce a glass of my favorite juice blend. Tropical Smoothie has the same exact drink for $4 in and out in a jiffy. NO clean up!!!! The juicer may find its way off my kitchen counter and into my go-to Goodwill box very soon.

The shop itself is a bit hidden despite being in downtown on he busiest street (St-Catherine). It is much less known than Nos Thés or Chatime that are located quite close to A Breuvage Shop.

1966,cafes_list,"I've tried the chrysanthemum tea with cranberry and was surprised to find that it makes for a good combination. The chrysanthemum wasn't overpowered by the cranberry although it is the more dominant flavor. For $4.4 (reg size) I thought it was pretty good. I also tried the siji tea with blueberry and black current. It includes bubbles already and has some blueberries and a slice of orange in it. I enjoyed this one too but it's overpriced and I couldn't really taste the tea although I could tell it wasn't 100% juice either. They have some other creative tea flavor combinations that I'm curious to try. It's a small place with only a couple of tables. They appear to sweeten their teas with honey and you can choose your level of ice and sweetness but I think you have to tell them the level explicitly as the person serving may not ask and assume regular for both. If you don't have one be sure to ask for a free loyalty card (they don't always ask you if you have one). Buy 5 drinks and get 1 free. In spite of their less than creative name and that ABS makes me think of car brakes instead of drinks, I will return here when I'm in the mood.",4-star,positive

The flavours were strong but they are more similar to a Hong Kong black tea. I feel like the grass jelly isn't as sweet as chatime but still had great texture. The staff were nice and there were enough people to serve the number of people in the cafe. There is also wifi and it's quiet enough to do some work on a weekend afternoon. I would definitely come back to sample a few more of their bubble teas (I didn't get bubbles so I can't comment on those yet). tip - they have a buy 5 get one free card you can get. it's a pretty decent loyalty program considering other places are buy 10 get 1.",3-star,negative

1971,cafes_list,"Holts Café is a trendy cafe on the mezzanine level of one of Yorkville's institutions, Holt Renfrew. The cafe was an elongated bright space with a red and light grey color scheme. It's an ideal setting for a casual lunch, business lunch, dates, or mid-afternoon shopping break. Mango Mule ($7) - Mocktail - Sweet and refreshing non-alcoholic beverage Grilled Jerk Shrimp ($14) - Containing jalapeño pineapple salsa - Only had a slight kick due to some regular clienteles complaining about the heat level - The jerk shrimp along with the sweet and juicy pineapple was a fantastic combo. The Fragrant Steamed Mussels ($13) - The seafood delicacy come together with the help of white wine and various spices to create a lovely aromatic smell - The broth itself was light and savory - Generous helping of mussels Chopped Salad ($19) - Decent option - Too light due to lack of French vinaigrette Pickerel ($27) - Perfectly cooked dish - The fish was lightly seasoned and complemented the creamy Jerusalem artichoke and French beans Strawberry Shortcake ($10) - Was literally a platter of sugar, which probably doesn't suit everyone's palette - Very sweet - Could add a few more strawberries to balance out the sweetness of the shortcake biscuits Chocolate Mousse ($10) - Definitely an airy and rich dessert Overall, our lunch at the Holts Café at Holt Renfrew Toronto was a very pleasant dining experience.

1972,cafes_list,"The Grilled Summer Tart was one of my favourite items that day. It had an arugula pesto, grilled zucchini, roasted peppers, and herbed goat cheese. This summer start actually looked like an open-face sandwich and was very healthy and made with fresh ingredients. All of the ingredients went so well together and I especially liked the herbed goat cheese and the flakey pastry of the tart. The herbed goat cheese was my favourite part of the Grilled Summer Tart! The Compressed Watermelon & Feta Salad had an artisanal lettuce bouquet, basil, mint, edible flowers, aged balsamic drizzle, and olive oil. The ingredients in this were also very fresh and high-quality. It looked so beautiful and colourful too. The edible flowers were delicate orange petals that actually didn't have a detectable flavour at all. The cutest part of this salad was the cubed watermelon that was topped with feta cheese. P and I both thought this combination of sweet juicy watermelon paired with feta was an interesting one. When you have the juicy watermelon paired with the feta, it makes the feta taste differently than when you eat the two separately. The Pickerel was paired with creamy Jerusalem artichoke, French beans, and shaved fennel. This was another beautifully presented dish that looked like fine dining food. The piece of pickerel was topped with the shaved slices of fennel and sat on top of the French beans and artichoke. This seafood dish was the second favourite dish for me. I loved how fresh, moist, and juicy the pickerel was. The seasoning wasn't strong at all which gave way to the freshness of the fish. I was thoroughly delighted with how great the pickerel was prepared and cooked. Kudos to the chef for preparing such a perfect piece of fish! ^_^ We also liked the French beans (so fresh and crunchy) and I liked the shaved fennel. The creamy Jerusalem artichoke was wonderful too and I wish I had a spoon on the side to scoop more of it up to go with each bite. The Strawberry Shortcake was not your typical kind of shortcake in a cake form. Instead, it arrived in a cute dessert sandwich presentation. It was made with a shortcake biscuit, pastry cream, strawberry compote, crème Anglaise, and Chantilly cream. It was a really cute dessert! I found that this was a unique take on the traditional strawberry shortcake dessert.",4-star,positive

That's right, according to the 30 something Chinese sales clerk in the men's section - the one with ghostly pale skin who thinks she's auditioning for a role on a Korean drama - this cafe doesn't exist. Update your records, Yelp! So this is what went down today, Sunday May 28th at noon. My family and I were shopping in the neighborhood when my toddler started getting fussy. I remembered that there was a small cafe here. When we walked in, I approached a clerk standing by the cashier nearest to the escalator. She was not doing a damn thing at the moment. So I approached her and asked, ""Excuse me, where is the cafe?"" She looked up at me with a blank stare and mouthed the word ""No"". SHE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE AUDIBLE, VERBAL SPEECH. With a rather confused look, I repeated my question, only to get the same pantomime expression from her. Needless to say, we immediately left and went to Sassafraz instead. And on the way out, I saw that she got on the phone. So there's no way in hell she has a speech issue. Just a deplorable rudeness issue. But LITERALLY I've never been confronted by such rudeness, incompetence and carelessness. I've shopped all over the world, but I can tell you that this is the first time an idle clerk has refused to even speak to me! And in case you think it matters, my entire family was dressed well and my toddler was very quiet and well behaved while we were on the store for the sum total of two minutes.",1-star,negative

They take pride in the brand and actually comp our lunch as an apology on behalf of the Yorkdale location. Their menu change all the time, so you may not be able to order exactly what we had. We ordered the Duck Confit on Pretzel bread, and Miso Black Cod. The duck was seasoned perfectly and the combination ingenious.

Not great for the restaurant that lied to us after I asked if we could sit at the bar when they told me no tables were available. No, I get it. They need to make sure everyone with a reservation gets a table. However, when we entered the restaurant, there were plenty of tables available and the bar had 4 people at it with 8-9 empty chairs. And there were three of us. Mr Manager Nathan, you stupid little boy, I'm not impressed by your overpriced suit you got on discount, or by the fact that you have an inferiority complex because you're a 5 foot midget. Ooh, I'm getting mean. Sorry. I take that last part back. Maybe Holt Renfrew head office can give you a few tips on how to work the floor (instead of aimlessly walking up and down between the tables), how not to lie to customers, and how to actually run a restaurant with a bit of class. Maybe take a trip to Gramercy Tavern or Eleven Madison Park. You can learn a few things, you little child from All-White-People Suburb, Ontario. The fact is, the food was fucking shit for two salads and a chicken pot pie for $100+. I mean, Toronto tries so hard to be like New York, but this is total amateur hour.

Truffle chips tasted like kettle cooked chips but a little too salty for my liking. The holts burger was exactly what it sounds like - just a burger. It was really well made for a burger but it was still just a burger. I didn't really like the holts club not only because it was an open faced sandwich but it was also dry.

1994,cafes_list,"Their frozen yogurt is to die for. Seriously, I strongly prefer this to other places. It's delicious and has a very subtle citrus taste to it. They also serve delicious healthy lunches. If you're looking for a breakfast, lunch or afternoon snack, it's worth checking out.",4-star,positive
1995,cafes_list,"I hate to be one of those obnoxious people who come from Montreal and compare everything in Toronto to how much 'better' everything is in Montreal--but to be honest the Holts Cafe in Montreal is about 10x better. First of all this location is great, perched high above Bloor Street looking out at the plebeians below you with an open airy feeling because of the large windows and skylight. My mum, boyfriend, and I ate along the window which was great--not too cold for all you concerned about Canadian winter weather. Our server was fine, nothing special rather pedestrian if I do say so myself. He welcomed us, took our drink orders, and returned to take our orders. No chit-chat which is either good or bad depending on how you like your servers. My main concern was the food. The menu is small which I think is good for an operation like Holts Cafe. Its best to keep it simple and focused. Like Montreal the Toronto location offers the infamous tartines--open-faced Scandinavian inspired sandwiches--on French poilâne bread. I love the tartines but because Toronto only offers 5-6 options (versus 10-12 in Montreal) I opted to try something else. My eyes immediately honed in on the Chicken Pot Pie which was fine. Just fine. Nothing too spectacular. The puff pastry was really quite tasty, but the 'chicken' inside was shredded and rather sad in quantity. I recently had a Chicken Pot Pie at Bannock (in the rapidly improving the Bay on Queen St. W.) which had huge chunks of fresh chicken breast. The Holts incarnation was tasty but gurrrrl I'm hungry, I'm not one of those ladies who like to lunch who pick at their food, drag it around the plate, and then claim rather exuberantly 'I'm full!'. No no I like my meals and I like them filling. My boyfriend had the Holts Burger which was good (I had to steal a bite!) with fries which were actually really good, with a nice sprinkling of spices with an assortment of dips including garlic aioli mayo (my favourite!). My mum had a tartine (the Grilled Chicken) but unfortunately it seemed like the chicken was of the 'lunch meat' variety rather than slices of chicken breast. The Montreal tartines with chicken had a different kind of chicken and I was a little disappointed by this variation. Although each restaurant has a different executive chef I would expect some sort of standardization in terms of the tartines. Oh well they were sufficient. The cocktails that we ordered--the special Very Berry Cocktail--was expensive ($14) and tiny, served in a champagne flute. While the main ingredient was prosecco I felt like a cocktail like this would best be served in a cocktail glass. But than again, I'm no bartender. This Holts underwent a renovation a few years back and the rest of the store is of high aesthetic quality. But like any high-end department store or boutique in Toronto I always feel like the service is severely lacking. All of the sales associates--save for one in Louis Vuitton department downstairs--has been so fucking snooty. Why is this such a trend? I KNOW you work on commission, lighten up a little bit and I'll buy more. Crikey. Anyways thats for another review. Bottom line: Holts Cafe is fab to the eye and super chic. The food is 'ok' and the service is unforgettable. But its a nice respite from the crowds of Bloor or the mediocrity of neighbouring food options.",3-star,negative
1996,cafes_list,"It's always a stop here for me either for a quick sandwich or my usual G&T. Always enjoyed the airy, bright, and clean lines either at the bar or in the lounge area. The food is good enough, I never had any issues with it, I only wish the portions were slightly bigger for the prices. Appearance of the food is above average as well as the salt/pepper/sauce dispensers. Service for me has always been efficient, friendly, and attentive. However, being inside Holt's on the 2nd floor with men's clothing on the 1st, do expect the majority of patrons to be women - not that there is anything wrong with that. I along with my male colleague were the only Y-chromes in the room beside the servers at one sitting. (No, I am not - but not that there is anything wrong with that either...) The Law has eaten and returns for beverages while walking down Bloor on occasion...",3-star,negative
1997,cafes_list,"it is nice to go there if you'd like to go shopping and have a different kind of lunch. the seating area is ideal and different. The food and service is only average. been there 3 times and it has been only average consistently. Wait times for orders are long. had to send back food each time as it was really cold (surprising eh?). it seems they are understaffed leading to longer wait times and delayed food delivery. i really would like them to see stepping it up with the food. not impressive, just average. wine menu is small but GOOD. however given it is freeriding on the HOLTs reputation and the location you get still a different shopping experience.",3-star,negative
1998,cafes_list,"My girlfriend and I had lunch there a few days ago on a Thursday - the mezzanine leveled Cafe - the one where Corbin, celebrity chef works as head chef and is a big reason why I wanted to try the restaurant. The ambiance is lovely - definitely an enchanting and special place to go have lunch. Service is fairly good as well. I have to say, when it came to the food, my main course was a little...disappointing...for appetizers, we started with Canadian baked brie - it was a small round brie that wasn't all that soft for having just been in the oven. It was accompanied with some sort of orange marmalade-like compote and corn chips. All looked ready to go into a miniature museum. We ordered truffled potato chips and each chip came out fairly brown (you'll see in my pics). Overly cooked, in my opinion. Then came my entree - I ordered the osso buco since that's something I don't eat everyday - although the flavors were nice and round, it was incredibly DRY. OMG, was it ever dry. Osso buco should be so tender, moist and juicy...this was just the opposite. I should've ordered the turkey pot pie like my girlfriend. I of course, had to order dessert, and had the sticky toffee pudding - I'm a sucker for it if it's on a menu and that, was a happy ending to this meh of a meal.",3-star,negative
1999,cafes_list,"If you are ever craving a pick and choose, cafeteria style lunch place with fresh food, a stand-alone hot beverage stand and yummy bite-sized cakes, head on over to Holt's Cafe! Located on the lowest level of the Holt Renfrew Centre on Bloor, this cafe is always a great reward once you have been shopping for hours and have worked up an appetite. For main lunch meals, Holt's Cafe offers a WIDE VARIETY of soups, salads and sandwiches. For sandwiches, they have freshly wrapped, pre-made sandwiches and they also offer large panini sandwiches, which are thrown onto the grill right before you take your first bite. Some of the sandwiches I have tried there that were absolutely delicious were the blackened chicken caesar sandwich, the garlic shrimp panini and the avocado tuna on whole wheat. After you are done your main lunch, why not indulge in a hot drink with a little dessert? The cafe has its own stand-alone cappucino stand, with a nice selection of coffee, latte, tea and hot chocolate options. And last but certainly not least, Holt's Cafe has a large amount of different desserts to settle anyone's sweet tooth. The only thing to be warned is that this cafe is PACKED during the working day lunch hour and you may have to shell out more money on certain food items. Overall, Holt's Cafe is just fresh and delicious! I give it an A!",4-star,positive
